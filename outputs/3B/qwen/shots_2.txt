This solution uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of edge cases, such as when one of the lists is exhausted before the other. The `addPoly` method iterates through both lists simultaneously, comparing the powers of the current nodes. It appends the node with the higher power to the result list, or the node with the same power after adding their coefficients. If the powers are equal, it adds the coefficients and keeps the power the same. Finally, it appends any remaining nodes from either list to the result. The result list is then returned, starting from the dummy node's next node. 

This approach ensures that the resulting polynomial is in strictly descending order by power and omits any terms with a coefficient of zero. The time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two input lists, and the space complexity is O(1) excluding the space used for the result list.

This solution iterates over all possible substrings of the input string `s`. For each substring, it calculates the beauty using a helper function `calculate_beauty` that computes the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies of the characters in the substring. The total beauty is accumulated and returned at the end. The use of `Counter` from the `collections` module simplifies the counting of character frequencies efficiently. 

This approach ensures that all substrings are considered, and the time complexity is manageable given the constraints of the problem.

```


**Code solution:** 

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not ops:
            return m * n

        min_col = min(op[1] for op in ops)
        
        return min_row * min_col
```


This solution works as follows:

1. If there are no operations (`ops` is empty), the entire matrix is filled with zeros, and the maximum count of the maximum integer is simply `m * n`.

2. Otherwise, we determine the minimum row index (`min_row`) and the minimum column index (`min_col`) from the operations. These indices represent the largest possible rectangle that can be formed by the operations.

3. The number of maximum integers in the matrix is the product of `min_row` and `min_col`, as this rectangle contains all the maximum integers in the matrix.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations. The time complexity is O(k), where k is the number of operations, and the space complexity is O(1).

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to color the nodes of the graph. The idea is to assign each node a color, either 1 or 0, such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If it is possible to color the entire graph with this property, then it is possible to split the group of people into two groups. If it is not possible, then it is not possible to split the group of people into two groups. The function `dfs` is used to perform the DFS traversal and color the nodes. If at any point a conflict is detected (i.e., two adjacent nodes have the same color), the function returns False. If the DFS traversal completes without detecting any conflicts, the function returns True. Finally, the function iterates over all nodes and starts DFS from each uncolored node. If all nodes are successfully colored, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. ```python

class Solution:
    def rearrangeBarcodes(self, barcodes: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Count the frequency of each barcode
        count = Counter(barcodes)
        
        # Create a max-heap based on negative frequencies
        heap = [(-freq, code) for code, freq in count.items()]

                heapq.heappush(heap, (freq + 1, code))
        
        return result
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Count Frequencies**: We use a `Counter` to count the frequency of each barcode.

2. **Create Max-Heap**: We create a max-heap using negative frequencies because Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default. Each element in the heap is a tuple containing the negative frequency and the corresponding barcode.

3. **Build Result Array**: We use a two-pointer approach to build the result array:
   - Pop the most frequent barcode from the heap.
   - Append the barcode to the result array.
   - If there is still one more of this barcode left, push it back into the heap.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the result array. This ensures that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. The constraints guarantee that an answer exists, so the algorithm will always produce a valid result. ```python
from collections import Counter
from heapq import nlargest

class Solution:
    def rearrangeBarcodes(self, barcodes: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Count the frequency of each barcode

        # Use two pointers to build the result array
        while heap:
            freq, code = heapq.heappop(heap)
            result.append(code)

```

**Explanation**:
1. The `backtrack` function is used to explore all possible sequences starting from indices `i` and `j`. It takes three parameters: `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `i` and `j` are the indices of the first two numbers in the sequence, and `k` is the count of numbers in the sequence.
2. The base case of the recursion is when `i` equals the length of the string. In this case, we check if the count of numbers `k` is at least 3. If it is, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.
3. If the current character at index `i` is '0', and `j` is 0, it means we are dealing with a single digit number. In this case, we recursively call `backtrack` with `i + 1` and `j` unchanged. If `j` is not 0, it means we are dealing with a multi-digit number that starts with '0', which is not allowed. In this case, we return `False`.
4. We iterate through all possible lengths of the first number starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + length`. If the substring `num[i:i + length]` is a valid integer, we check if it is equal to the substring `num[j:j + length

This solution works by performing an in-order traversal of the binary search tree.

```
    
    The solution class contains a method `reorderedPowerOf2` that checks if the digits of the given number `N` can be rearranged to form a power of two. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Count Digits Function**: A helper function `count_digits` is defined to count the frequency of each digit in a given number.

2. **Generate Powers of Two**: A list comprehension is used to generate all powers of two up to `1 << 30`, which covers the range of numbers that can be represented by an integer in Python.

3. **Check Each Power of Two**: For each power of two, the `count_digits` function is used to count the digits of both `N` and the current power of two. If the digit counts match, it means the digits of `N` can be rearranged to form the power of two.

4. **Return Result**: If any power of two matches the digit count of `N`, the function returns `True`. If none match, it returns `False`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible powers of two and determine if their digit counts match the given number `N`. The time complexity is O(30 * 10) = O(300), which is feasible given the constraints.

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum window in `s` that contains all characters in `t`. It maintains two counters: one for the characters in `t` and another for the current window in `s`. As it slides the window across `s`, it adjusts the counters to reflect the current window and updates the start and end indices of the minimum window found. The solution ensures that

The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring strings that can be obtained by swapping two characters in the current string to match the corresponding characters in the target string. The BFS explores all possible paths, starting from the initial string `A`, and stops when it reaches the target string `B`. The number of steps required to reach `B` is returned as the result. If no such path exists, the function returns -1. 

This solution is efficient and works well within the given constraints. It ensures that the smallest number of swaps is found by exploring all possible paths in a systematic manner. Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!

This solution works as follows:

1. It first determines the first and last row and column that contain at least one '1' in the image.
2. Then, it calculates the area of the smallest rectangle that can enclose all the '1's by subtracting the indices of the first and last rows and columns from the total number of rows and columns, respectively.
3. If no '1's are found in the image, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the calculated area.

And here are the helper functions:

        name = name.lower()

        elif len(digits) == 13:
            return "+***-***-***-" + digits[-4:]
```

This solution works as follows:

1. The `maskPII` method checks if the input string `s` contains an '@' symbol. If it does, it calls the `mask_email` method to mask the email address. Otherwise, it calls the `mask_phone` method to mask the phone number.

2. The `mask_email` method splits the input string into the name and domain parts, converts both parts to lowercase, and then checks the length of the name. If the length is less than or equal to 5, it replaces the first and last characters with asterisks and concatenates them with the domain part. Otherwise, it replaces the middle characters with asterisks and concatenates them with the domain part.

3. The `mask_phone` method removes all non-digit characters from the input string, converts the result to a string, and then checks the length of the string. Based on the length, it formats the masked phone number according to the specified rules and returns the result. ```python
```python
class Solution:
    def maskPII(self, s: str) -> str:
        if '@' in s:
            return self.mask_email(s)
        else:
            return self.mask_phone(s)

This solution works as follows:
1. Initialize `result` to store the total number of subarrays and `current_length` to track the length of the current strictly increasing subarray.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3. If the current element is greater than the previous element, increment `current_length`.
4. If the current element is not greater than the previous element, calculate the number of subarrays that can be formed from the current strictly increasing subarray using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, `(current_length * (current_length + 1)) // 2`, and add this to `result`. Then reset `current_length` to 1.
5. After the loop, add the number of subarrays that can be formed from the last strictly increasing subarray to `result`.
6. Return the `result`. ``` ``` ```python

        return max_width
```


This solution uses a stack to keep track of indices of elements in `nums` that are still candidates for forming a ramp. For each element, it calculates the minimum index of a subsequent element that is greater than or equal to the current element, which represents the potential ramp width. Finally, it finds the maximum ramp width among all possible ramps. The time complexity is O(n) due to the single pass through the array with the stack, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the `min_right` array and the stack. 

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `min_right` with the length of `nums` because the maximum possible ramp width is when the smallest element is at the end. We also initialize an empty stack to keep track of indices.

2. **Finding Minimum Right Index**: We iterate through the array with an index `i`. For each element `nums[i]`, we pop elements from the stack that are greater than `nums[i]` because they cannot form a valid ramp with `nums[i]` as the minimum element. We then push the current index `i` onto the stack. This ensures that the stack always contains indices of elements that can potentially form a ramp with the current element.

3. **Calculating Maximum Width**: After processing all elements, we iterate through the `min_right` array to calculate the maximum width of a ramp. For each index `i`, the maximum width of a ramp starting at `i` is `min_right[i] - i`. We update the `max_width` accordingly.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we

class Solution:
    def numWays(self, steps: int, arrLen: int) -> int:
```
**Solution Explanation:** 
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach index `j` after exactly `i` steps. The key observation is that we can only move one step at a time, either to the left, right, or stay in place.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a DP table `dp` with dimensions `(steps + 1) x (arrLen + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` will store the number of ways to reach index `j` after `i` steps. We also initialize a variable `mod` to handle large numbers by taking modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Base Case**: The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1`, which means there's one way to be at index `0` after `0` steps (doing nothing).

3. **DP Transition**: For each step `i` from `1` to `steps`, and for each index `j` from `0` to `arrLen - 1`, we update `dp[i][j]` based on the previous states:
   - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]`: Moving to the same position.
   - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][max(0, j-1)]`: Moving to the left.
   - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][min(arrLen-1, j+1)]`: Moving to the right.

4. **Result**: The result will be stored in `dp[steps][0]`, which represents the number of ways to be at index `0` after `steps` steps.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we take modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step to keep the numbers manageable.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, steps: int, arrLen: int) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Initialize DP table
        dp = [[0] * (arrLen + 1) for _ in range(steps +

        if p < 0 or p >= arrLen or p > steps - p:
            return 0
        if s == 0:
            return p == 0
        return (dp(s - 1, p - 1) + dp(s - 1, p) + dp(s - 1, p + 1)) % mod

    return dp(steps, 0)

**Solution Code:**

    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Calculate the number of bits required to represent the range
        num_bits = len(bin(right)) - 2
        
        # Initialize the result with the maximum value
        result = 2 ** num_bits - 1
        
        # Iterate over the range to find the common prefix
        for i in range(num_bits - 1, -1, -1):
            if left & (1 << i) != right & (1 << i):
                result &= ~(1 << i)
        
        return result
```
This solution works as follows:

1. Determine the number of bits required to represent the range `[left, right]`. This is done by converting the right boundary to binary and subtracting 2 (to account for the '0b' prefix).

2. Initialize the result with the maximum value that can be represented by the number of bits, which is `2 ** num_bits - 1`.

3. Iterate over the bits from the most significant bit to the least significant bit:
   - For each bit position `i`, check if the bit is set in both `left` and `right`.
   - If the bits are different, set the corresponding bit in the result to 0 using bitwise AND with the complement of `1 << i`.

4. Return the final result, which contains the common prefix of all numbers in the range.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the common prefix by iterating over the bits and adjusting the result accordingly. The time complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of bits required to represent the range, and the space complexity is O(1).

```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Graph Construction**: We first build an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given paths. Each garden is represented by a node, and the edges represent the paths between gardens.

2. **Flower Assignment**: For each garden, we try to assign a flower type such that it is different from the flower types assigned to its neighboring gardens. We use a set `available_flowers` to keep track of the flower types that are still available for assignment.

3. **Assigning Flower Types**: For each garden, we iterate over its neighbors and remove the flower types used by its neighbors from the `available_flowers` set. Then, we assign the remaining flower type to the current garden.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the list of flower types assigned to each garden.

This approach ensures that for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers, and it works efficiently given the constraints. Here is the complete implementation:

        return total_price if remaining_capacity == 0 else -1
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort Items**: The items are sorted based on their price per unit weight in descending order. This ensures that the items with the highest value per unit weight are considered first.

2. **Initialize Variables**: We initialize `total_price` to accumulate the total price of items added to the bag and `remaining_capacity` to keep track of the available capacity in the bag.

3. **Iterate Through Items**: We iterate through each item in the sorted list:
   - If the remaining capacity is sufficient to accommodate the full weight of the item, we add its full price to `total_price` and subtract its weight from `remaining_capacity`.
   - If the remaining capacity is not sufficient, we calculate the fraction of the item that can fit in the remaining capacity and add the corresponding price to `total_price`. We then break out of the loop as we cannot add more items.

4. **Check Remaining Capacity**: After processing all items, we check if the remaining capacity is zero. If it is, we return the `total_price`. Otherwise, we return -1 to indicate that it is not possible to fill the bag with the given items.

```


This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree. It maintains a dictionary to count the occurrences of each label in the subtree rooted at each node. The `dfs` function recursively counts the labels in the subtree of each node and updates the result list with the count for each node. The `visited` list ensures that each node is only processed once. Finally, the function returns the result list containing the count of each label in the subtree for each node. This approach ensures that all nodes are processed and the counts are accurate.

                min_val = min(min_val, nums[j])

```

This solution iterates through each element in the array and calculates the minimum and maximum values for each subarray starting from that element. It then adds the difference between the maximum and minimum values to the result. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. However, it meets the requirements of the problem statement. If you need an O(n) solution, you might consider using a stack-based approach or other advanced techniques. ``` ``` ```python
class Solution:
    def subArrayRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        min_stack = []
        max_stack = []
        
        min_sums = [0] * n
        max_sums = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Calculate the sum of subarrays ending at i with minimum value
            while min_stack and nums[min_stack[-1]] >= nums[i]:
                min_stack.pop()
            if min_stack:
                min_sums[i] = min_sums[min_stack[-1]] + (i - min_stack[-1]) * nums[i]
            min_stack.append(i)
            
            # Calculate the sum of subarrays ending at i with maximum value
            while max_stack and nums[max_stack[-1]] <= nums[i]:

            max_stack.append(i)
        
        return sum(max_sums) - sum(min_sums)
```

This solution uses two stacks to keep track of the indices of elements with the minimum and maximum values encountered so far. It calculates the sum of subarrays ending at each index with the minimum and maximum values and stores these sums in arrays. Finally, it returns the difference between the sum of subarrays

This solution uses the Union-Find data structure to efficiently manage and query the connected components in the graph formed by the friends. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Union-Find Initialization**: We initialize a parent array for each person, setting each person as their own parent.

2. **Union Operation**: The `union` function merges two sets (or connected components) by finding their roots and making one root point to the other.

3. **Find Operation**: The `find` function finds the root of a given node by recursively traversing the parent array until it reaches the root.

4. **Friend Request Processing**:
   - For each friend request `(u, v)`, we check if they are already connected (`pu == pv`).
   - If they are not connected, we check if there are any restrictions between `u` and `v`. If there are no restrictions or the restrictions do not affect the connection, we merge the sets using the `union` function.
   - We append `True` to the result list if the request is successful, otherwise `False`.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the list of results indicating whether each friend request was successful.

This approach ensures that the union-find operations are efficient, and the checks for restrictions are performed correctly, allowing us to determine the success of each friend request. The time complexity is manageable given the constraints, as the number of operations is relatively small compared to the size of the input.

        dp = [0] * n

        # Return the maximum number of books we can take from the bookshelf
        return max(dp)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum number of books we can take from the bookshelf up to each shelf. We iterate through each shelf and calculate the number of books we can take from that shelf to the end of the sequence. We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the total number of books we can take from a contiguous section of shelves. We then update the dynamic programming table with the maximum number of books we can take from the bookshelf up to each shelf. Finally, we return the maximum number of books we can take from the bookshelf. This approach ensures that we consider all possible contiguous sections of shelves and calculate the maximum number of books we can take from each section. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, but it is efficient enough for the given constraints. **End of Solution** ```python

This solution works as follows:

1. We use a stack to process the characters of the string `s`.
2. For each character in the string:
   - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same as the current character, we pop the top of the stack.
   - Otherwise, we push the current character onto the stack.
3. After processing all characters, the stack will contain the characters that are not part of any prefix or suffix that can be removed.
4. We then remove any consecutive duplicates from the stack.
5. Finally, we return the length of the stack, which represents the minimum length of the string after performing the operations any number of times. 

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and remove the longest possible prefixes and suffixes that are identical. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, and the space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where all characters are unique.

This solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths starting from each cell in the grid. It checks if the current path matches the word by recursively visiting adjacent cells. If a match is found, it returns `True`. If no match is found after exploring all paths, it returns `False`.

The `dfs` function performs the following steps:
1. Check if the current index `idx` has reached the length of the word. If so, return `True`.
2. If the current position `(i, j)` is out of bounds or does not match the current character in the word, return `False`.
3. Temporarily mark the current cell as visited by replacing it with a `#`.
4. Recursively explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and check if a match is found.
5. If a match is found, return `True`.
6. If no match is found after exploring all directions, restore the original character and return `False`.

This approach ensures that all possible paths are explored, and the solution works efficiently for small grids. However, for larger grids, additional optimizations such as search pruning could be considered to improve performance. Let me know if you need further assistance!

**Solution:** 
 
    ```python
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # Recursively trim the left subtree
        root.left = self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)
        
        # Recursively trim the right subtree
        root.right = self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)
        
        # If the current node's value is less than low, trim the left subtree
        if root.val < low:
            return root.right
        
        # If the current node's value is greater than high, trim the right subtree
        if root.val > high:
            return root.left
        
        # Return the current node if it falls within the range
        return root
```

This solution works by recursively trimming the left and right subtrees of the BST. If the current node's value is less than the `low` boundary, we trim the left subtree. If the current node's value is greater than the `high` boundary, we trim the right subtree. If the current node's value falls within the range, we return the current node. This ensures that the relative structure of the elements that remain in the tree is preserved. **Note**: The provided solution does not handle the case where the entire tree is outside the range, which would result in an empty tree. If you need to handle such cases, additional checks can be added to ensure that the root remains within the range after trimming. Here is the updated solution:

# Your MyHashSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyHashSet()
# obj.add(key)

# param_3 = obj.contains(key)
```
This implementation uses a list to store the keys. The `add` method checks if the key is already in the list and appends it if not. The `remove` method checks if the key is in the list and removes it if present. The `contains` method checks if the key is in the list and returns `True` if it is, otherwise `False`. This approach ensures that all operations are performed in constant time on average, making it suitable for small datasets. However, for larger datasets, a more efficient data structure like a hash table might be preferable. 

Here's a simple example of how you might use this class:

```python
# Create a new instance of MyHashSet
my_set = MyHashSet()

# Add some keys to the set
my_set.add(1)
my_set.add(2)
my_set.add(3)

# Check if keys are in the set
print(my_set.contains(1))  # Output: True
print(my_set.contains(4))  # Output: False

# Remove a key from the set
my_set.remove(2)

# Check if the key has been removed

```

This example demonstrates how to create a `MyHashSet` instance, add keys, check for the presence of keys, and remove keys. The `contains` method is used to verify that keys are present or not. 

If you have any questions or need further modifications, feel free to ask!

This solution class implements the `VideoSharingPlatform` interface with the required methods. It uses dictionaries to store the videos, their views, likes, and dislikes. The `upload` method adds a new video to the platform, assigning it the next available video ID. The `remove` method deletes a video if it exists. The `watch` method increments the view count for a video and returns the substring of the video starting from the specified start minute

        total_ascii_sum = sum(ord(c) for c in s1) + sum(ord(c) for c in s2)

        # The result is the total ASCII sum minus twice the sum of the characters in the longest common subsequence
        return total_ascii_sum - 2 * dp[m][n]
```


This solution uses dynamic programming to build a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ASCII sum of deleting characters to make the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` equal. The base cases are when either string is empty, and the recursive cases handle the matching and non-matching characters. Finally, the result is calculated by subtracting twice the sum of the characters in the longest common subsequence from the total ASCII sum of both strings.

This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible configurations of the board. It maintains a queue of tuples containing the current board state and the number of moves taken to reach that state. The BFS ensures that the first time the target state ('123450') is reached, it is the minimum number of moves required. The solution keeps track of visited

class Solution:
    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the result with the first element of the sequence
        result = start
        
        # Iterate through the sequence from start + 2 to start + 2*(n-1)
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Update the result by XORing it with the next element in the sequence
            result ^= (start + 2 * i)
        
        return result
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize the `result` variable with the value of `start`, which is the first element of the sequence.
2. Use a loop to iterate through the sequence from `start + 2` to `start + 2*(n-1)`.
3. In each iteration, update the `result` by XORing it with the current element in the sequence.
4. Finally, return the `result`, which contains the bitwise XOR of all elements in the sequence. 

This approach ensures that you correctly compute the XOR of all elements in the sequence without explicitly generating the entire array. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the sequence, and the space complexity is O(1). 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

                left += 1
        
        return min_length
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Calculate the target count for each character ('Q', 'W', 'E', 'R') by dividing the total length of the string by 4.

2. Use a counter to keep track of the current counts of each character in the string.

3. If the string is already balanced (i.e., all counts are equal to the target), return 0.

4. Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of the string.

5. Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and updating the balance accordingly.

6. When the balance is less than or equal to 0, it means the current window is valid, and we try to minimize the window size by moving the `left` pointer.

7. Update the minimum length of the valid window and continue the process.

8. Finally, return the minimum length found. If no valid window is found, `min_length` will remain infinity, which is not possible in this case due to the constraints. Therefore, it will always return a valid length.```python

```
This solution works by iterating through each element in the array and using a temporary variable `tmp` to keep track of the value being processed. The value at index `i` is negated to mark it as visited, and then the process continues with the new value at the original index. This continues until a negative value is encountered, indicating that the cycle has been completed. The length of the cycle is then recorded and compared with the maximum length found so far. Finally, the maximum length is returned as the result. This approach ensures that each element is processed only once, resulting in an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).

        self.cells = set(range(self.total_cells))
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
  - We calculate the total number of cells `m * n`.
  - We initialize a set `cells` containing all indices from `0` to `total_cells - 1`.
  - We create an instance of `random.Random()` to use for generating random numbers.

- **Flip Method (`flip` method):**
  - If the set `cells` is empty, it means there are no free cells left, so we return `None`.
  - We randomly select a cell from the set using `self.random.choice()`.
  - We remove the selected cell from the set.
  - We convert the cell index back to row and column using integer division and modulo operations.
  - We return the row and column indices as a list.

- **Reset Method (`reset` method):**
  - We reset the set `cells` to include all indices from `0` to `total_cells - 1`, effectively resetting the state of the matrix. 

This solution ensures that each cell has an equal probability of being selected for flipping, and it minimizes the number of calls to the built-in random function. The time complexity for each flip operation is O(1) on average, and the space complexity is O(m * n) for storing the set of cells. The reset operation takes O(m * n) time to reset the set. **

class Solution:
    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```
**Solution Explanation:** 
```python
class Solution:
    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        total_sum = sum(chalk)
        k %= total_sum
        
        current_sum = 0
        for i, chalk in enumerate(chalk):
            current_sum += chalk
            if current_sum > k:
                return i
```


**Explanation:** 

1. **Calculate Total Sum**: 
   - First, calculate the total sum of all chalk values in the array. This gives us the total amount of chalk available.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the problem can wrap around due to the large value of `k`, perform a modulo operation on `k` with the total sum. This ensures that `k` is within the bounds of the array's length.

3. **Iterate Through Chalk**:
   - Initialize `current_sum` to keep track of the cumulative sum of chalk used so far.
   - Iterate through the chalk array:
     - Add the current chalk value to `current_sum`.
     - Check if `current_sum` exceeds `k`. If it does, return the current index `i` because the student at this index will need to replace the chalk.

This approach efficiently finds the index of the student who will need to replace the chalk using a single pass through the chalk array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n). The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space. 

Let's test the solution with the provided examples:

```python
# Test case 1
print(Solution().chalkReplacer([5, 1, 5], 22))  # Output: 0

# Test case 2
print(Solution().chalkReplacer([3, 4, 1, 2], 25))  # Output: 1
```

These test cases should return the expected outputs based on the problem description. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!

                    indegree[seq[i + 1]] += 1
        
        # Find nodes with indegree 0
        queue = deque([node for node in org if indegree[node] == 0])
        
        # Reconstruct the sequence
        reconstructed = []
        while queue:
            if len(queue) > 1:

            node = queue.popleft()
            reconstructed.append(node)
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return reconstructed == org
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Graph Construction**: We build a directed graph where each node represents an element in `org` and each edge represents a sequence that connects two consecutive elements in the sequence.

2. **Indegree Calculation**: We calculate the indegree of each node, which represents the number of incoming edges. Nodes with an indegree of 0 are potential starting points for the sequence reconstruction.

3. **Queue Initialization**: We initialize a queue with nodes that have an indegree of 0.

4. **Sequence Reconstruction**: We reconstruct the sequence by processing nodes in the queue. For each node, we append it to the result and decrement the indegree of its neighbors. If a neighbor's indegree becomes 0, we add it to the queue.

5. **Validation**: After processing all nodes, we validate that the reconstructed sequence matches `org`. If it does, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that we correctly reconstruct the sequence and validate its uniqueness based on the given constraints.

``` 

This solution uses a prefix sum approach to efficiently count the number of subarrays that sum to `k`. It maintains a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` to keep track of how many times each prefix sum has occurred. As it iterates through the array, it calculates the current prefix sum and checks if `prefix_sum - k` has been seen before. If it has, it means there is a subarray ending at the current position that sums to `k`. The count of such subarrays is added to the result. The dictionary is updated with the current prefix sum to handle future occurrences. This approach ensures that the solution runs in O(n) time complexity and uses O(n) space complexity.

        for node in tree:
            if node.val not in seen:
                return node
```
    
This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of the values of nodes that have been encountered as children of other nodes.

2. We iterate over each node in the `tree` list. For each node, we iterate over its `children` list and add the value of each child to the `seen` set.

3. After processing all nodes, we iterate over the `tree` list again. For each node, we check if its value is not in the `seen` set. If it is not, then that node must be the root of the tree because it does not have any children that are present in the `seen` set.

4. We return the root node.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because we iterate over the tree twice. The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of unique node values in the tree, because we store the values of the children in the `seen` set. This solution does not use constant space complexity with a linear time algorithm. However, it can be optimized further to achieve constant space complexity with a linear time algorithm. One possible approach is to use a hash map to keep track of the values of nodes that have been encountered as children of other nodes, and then iterate over the tree once to find the root node. This approach would require more complex code and may not be as straightforward as the previous solution. However, it could potentially achieve constant space complexity with a linear time algorithm. Here is the optimized solution:

```python

**Solution Code:**

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        # Count the frequency of each character in both strings
        count_s = Counter(s)
        count_t = Counter(t)
        
        # Calculate the number of steps needed
        steps = 0
        for char, freq in count_s.items():
            if char in count_t:
                steps += abs(freq - count_t[char])
        
        return steps
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in both strings `s` and `t`.

2. We initialize a variable `steps` to keep track of the total number of steps needed.

3. We iterate over each character in the frequency count of `count_s`. For each character, we check if it exists in `count_t`.

4. If the character exists in `count_t`, we calculate the absolute difference between the frequencies of the character in `s` and `t`. This difference represents the number of steps needed to make the frequencies equal.

5. We add the calculated difference to `steps`.

6. Finally, we return the total number of steps. This is the minimum number of steps required to make `s` and `t` anagrams of each other. 

This approach ensures that we consider all characters and their frequencies, and efficiently calculates the minimum number of steps needed to make the strings anagrams. The time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of strings `s` and `t`, respectively, and the space complexity is O(1) since the size of the character set is fixed (26 lowercase English letters). 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. 

**Additional Explanation:**

The idea behind this solution is to balance the frequencies of each character between the two strings. By calculating the absolute difference between the frequencies of each character in `s` and `t`, we determine how many steps are needed to make the frequencies equal. The sum of these differences gives us the minimum number of steps required to make the strings anagrams of each other. 

By iterating over each character in `count_s`, we ensure that we consider all characters and their frequencies, and efficiently calculate

        # Create a dictionary to count the occurrences of each feature in responses

```

This solution works as follows:

1. We use a `defaultdict` to keep track of the count of each feature in the `responses` list.
2. We iterate through each response and split it into individual words.
3. For each word, if it is in the `features` list, we increment its count in the `feature_count` dictionary.
4. After counting the occurrences of each feature, we sort the `features` list based on their count in descending order. If two features have the same count, we sort them by their original index in the `features` list.
5. Finally, we return the sorted list of features.

            ans.append(ways)
        
        return ans
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to fill the array. It precomputes factorials and modular inverses to avoid recalculating them multiple times. For each query, it calculates the number of ways to fill the array using the formula:

\[ \text{ways} = \left(\frac{\text{ki}}{\text{fact}[0]} \times \frac{\text{ki}}{\text{fact}[1]} \times \cdots \times \frac{\text{ki}}{\text{fact}[ni-1]}\right) \mod \text{mod} \]

Finally, it appends the result to the answer list and returns it. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where n is the number of queries and m is the maximum value of ni and ki. The space complexity is O(n * m) due to the storage of factorials and modular inverses. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input values for ni and ki are within the range of a standard integer data type (e.g., int in Python). If the values are larger, you may need to use a more efficient data type or approach. Additionally, this solution assumes that ki is always a positive integer. If ki can be zero, you may need to handle that case separately. Let me know if you have any further questions!

```

This solution works as follows:

1. We create a dictionary `pos` to map each number in `nums2` to its corresponding index.

2. We use two arrays `inc` and `dec` to store the number of increasing and decreasing subsequences ending at each position, respectively.

3. For each position `i`, we iterate through all previous positions `j` and update the `inc` array if `nums1[j] < nums1[i]`.

4. Similarly, for each position `i`, we iterate through all subsequent positions `j` and update the `dec` array if `nums1[j] > nums1[i]`.

5. Finally, we iterate through all numbers in `nums1` and calculate the number of good triplets by summing up the products of the number of increasing subsequences ending at the position of `nums1[i]` and the number of decreasing subsequences starting at the position of `nums1[i]`.

6. We return the total number of good triplets. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested

The above solution works correctly, but it has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is inefficient for large inputs. Can you optimize the solution to achieve a better time complexity? Here's a Python implementation that optimizes the solution to O(n):

```python

    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        n = len(boxes)
        left = [0] * n
        right = [0] * n
        count = 0
        
        # Calculate the number of balls to the left of each box
        for i in range(n):
            left[i] = count

                count += 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations for each box
        result = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            result[i] = left[i] + right[i]
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize two arrays, `left` and `right`, to store the cumulative number of balls to the left and right of each box, respectively. We also initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of balls encountered so far.

2. **Left Pass**: We iterate through the boxes from left to right. For each box, we add the current `count` to the `left` array. If the current box contains a ball ('1'), we increment the `count`.

3. **Right Pass**: We iterate through the boxes from right to left. For each box, we add the current `count` to the `right` array. If the current box contains a ball ('1'), we increment the `count`.

4. **Result Calculation**: Finally, we iterate through the boxes again and calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the current

```

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to mark all farmland cells in a group starting from a given cell. It keeps track of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the group by updating the boundaries during the DFS traversal. Once a group is identified, its boundaries are appended to the result list. The DFS ensures that all cells in the group are marked as visited and that the boundaries are correctly determined. The solution efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output for each test case.

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum points that can be earned up to each question. The `dp` array stores the maximum points that can be earned starting from each question. The `dp` array is initialized with the last question's points, and then for each question, the maximum points that can be earned either by skipping the current question or solving it is calculated. The result is stored in the first element of the `dp` array. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `questions` array.

        # Check if each pair in queries is connected
        return [find(i) == find(j) for i, j in queries]
```


This solution uses the Union-Find data structure to efficiently manage and query connections between cities. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Union-Find Initialization**: We initialize a parent array to represent the root of each city. Initially, each city is its own root.

2. **Find Function**: The `find` function uses path compression to find the root of a city. This helps in making future queries faster.

3. **Union Function**: The `union` function merges two cities by setting the root of one city to the root of the other.

4. **Processing Multiples**: For each number greater than the threshold, we find all its multiples and union them. This ensures that all cities with a common divisor greater than the threshold are connected.

5. **Query Processing**: For each query, we check if the roots of the two cities are the same. If they are, the cities are connected; otherwise, they are not.

This approach ensures efficient connectivity checks for all pairs of cities in the given range. The time complexity for processing all cities and queries is \(O(n \log n)\), which is suitable for the given constraints. **Feel free to ask if you have any questions!**

This solution works as follows:

1. First, it checks if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different. If they are, it returns `False` because it's impossible to convert `s` into `t` if their lengths are different.

2. It initializes an empty dictionary `shifts` to keep track of the number of times each shift is needed.

3. It iterates through the characters of `s` and `t`. For each character, it calculates the difference between the ASCII values of the corresponding characters in `s` and `t`. If the difference is negative, it adds 26 to make it positive (since the alphabet wraps around).

4. It updates the `shifts` dictionary with the count of each shift.

5. It then iterates through the `shifts` dictionary. For each shift, it calculates the total number of shifts needed by adding the shift itself and the number of times it needs to be shifted by 26 (to handle cases where the shift is greater than 26).

6. If the total number of shifts needed is greater than `k`, it returns `False`.

7. If all shifts are within the limit, it returns `True`. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the strings `s` and `t`, and a space complexity of O(1) since the number of possible shifts is limited to 25. The constraints ensure that this solution will work efficiently.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

Return the **number of ways** to reach the target by performing the following operations:

1.  Choose an index `i` and increment `nums[i]` by 1.
2.  Choose an index `i` and decrement `nums[i]` by 1.

You can perform the operations any number of times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,1], target = 3
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** There are 5 ways to reach the target.
1. Increment nums[0] three times.
2. Increment nums[1] one time and decrement nums[2] one time.
3. Decrement nums[0] one time and increment nums[3] one time.
4. Decrement nums[0] two times and increment nums[1] two times.
5. Decrement nums[2] three times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], target = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are 2 ways to reach the target.
1. Increment nums[1] one time and decrement nums[2] two times.
2. Decrement nums[0] two times and increment nums[1] one time.

            if nums[i] > max_val:
                # Calculate the number of splits needed
                splits = (nums[i] + max_val - 1) // max_val
                operations += splits - 1
                max_val = nums[i] // splits
        
        return operations
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `operations` to keep track of the number of replacements and `max_val` to the last element of the array.
2. Iterate through the array from the second last element to the first element.
3. For each element, if it is greater than `max_val`, calculate the number of splits needed to make it less than or equal to `max_val`.
4. Update the `operations` count by adding the number of splits minus one (since the first split does not require an additional replacement).
5. Update `max_val` to the integer division of the current element by the number of splits.
6. Return the total number of operations. 

This approach ensures that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order with the minimum number of replacements. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is O(1).

``` 

This solution uses two stacks to perform an in-order traversal of both binary search trees. It then iterates through the stacks, comparing the values of the nodes at the top of each stack. If the sum of the values equals the target, it returns `True`. If the sum is less than the target, it moves to the next node in the left subtree of the first stack. If the sum is greater than the target, it moves to the next node in the right subtree of the second stack. If either stack is exhausted without finding a match, it returns `False`. 

This approach ensures that all possible pairs of nodes from the two trees are checked, and it efficiently handles the constraints given in the problem statement. 

Let me know if you need any further assistance! 

### Explanation:

1. **In-order Traversal**: The `dfs` function performs an in-order traversal of the binary search tree rooted at `node`. It appends each node to the stack `stack`.

2. **Stack Initialization**: Two stacks, `stack1` and `stack2`, are initialized to store the nodes of `root1` and `root2`, respectively.

3. **Iterate Through Stacks**: The main loop continues until both stacks are empty. In each iteration:
   - It pops the top nodes from `stack1` and `stack2`.
   - It checks if the sum of the values of these nodes equals the target. If it does, it returns `True`.
   - If the sum is less than the target, it moves to

**Solution:**

        # "a" and "b". So, the minimum number of steps is 2.
        return 2
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Check if the string is empty**: If the string is empty, it can be removed in a single step, so return 0.

2. **Check if the string is a palindrome**: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. If the string is a palindrome, it can be removed in a single step, so return 1.

3. **If the string is not a palindrome**: Since the string is not a palindrome, it can be reduced to two subsequences: one containing all 'a's and the other containing all 'b's. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to remove all characters from the string is 2. Return 2. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of steps needed to remove all characters from the string based on whether it is a palindrome or not. 

**Code Explanation:**

- We first check if the string is empty. If it is, we return 0 because no steps are needed.
- We then check if the string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`). If they are the same, the string is a palindrome, and we return 1.
- If the string is not a palindrome, we know that it can be reduced to two subsequences of 'a's and 'b's. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required is 2, and we return 2. 

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) for checking if the string is a palindrome and a space complexity of O(1).

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `left_sum` to 0 and calculate the total sum of the array `nums`.
2. Iterate through the array using a for loop, keeping track of the current index `i` and the current number `num`.
3. For each number, check if the `left_sum` is equal to the total sum minus the `left_sum` minus the current number. This means that the sum of the numbers before the current index is equal to the sum of the numbers after the current index.
4. If this condition is met, return the current index `i`.
5. If the loop completes without finding a valid middle index, return -1.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, and a space complexity of O(1). The space complexity is constant because we are only using a few extra variables to keep track of the sums and the index. The time complexity is linear because we are iterating through the array once. The solution is efficient and works well for the given constraints.

**Solution Explanation:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Alice can win the game when playing optimally against Bob. The game involves removing nodes from a Fibonacci tree and the player who removes the root node loses.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Base Cases**: 
   - If `n == 1`, Alice cannot remove the root node, so she loses. Thus, `fibTreeGame(1)` should return `False`.
   - If `n == 2`, Alice can remove the root node, leaving Bob with a single node. Bob loses, so `fibTreeGame(2)` should return `True`.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For `n > 2`, Alice can choose to remove either the left subtree (`order(n - 2)`) or the right subtree (`order(n - 1)`).
   - If Alice removes the left subtree, Bob will face the subtree with `order(n - 2)`. If Alice removes the right subtree, Bob will face the subtree with `order(n - 1)`.
   - Alice wins if Bob loses in either case. Therefore, Alice wins if `not fibTreeGame(n - 2)` or `not fibTreeGame(n - 1)`.

3. **Memoization**:
   - To optimize the recursive calls, we can use memoization to store the results of previously computed values of `fibTreeGame(n)`.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def fibTreeGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # Memoization dictionary to store results
        memo = {}
        
        def helper(n):
            # Base cases
            if n == 1:
                return False
            if n == 2:
                return True
            
            # Check if result is already computed
            if n in memo:
                return memo[n]
            
            # Recursive case
            # Alice wins if Bob loses in either subtree
            memo[n] = not helper(n - 2) or not helper(n - 1)
            
            return memo[n]
        
        return helper(n)
```

### Explanation:

- **Base Cases**: We handle the cases where `n == 1` and `n == 2` directly.
- **Recursive Case**: For `n > 2`, we 27%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹       | 8/30 [01:36<04:25, 12.09s/it]

**Code solution:**

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numSubmat(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        result = 0

        # Helper function to calculate the number of submatrices ending at (i, j)
        def count_submat(i, j):
            height = mat[i][j]
            for k in range(i - 1, -1, -1):

                    count_submat(i, j)

        return result
``` 

This solution works by iterating through each cell in the matrix and using a helper function to count the number of submatrices that can be formed ending at that cell. The helper function calculates the minimum height of consecutive ones from the current cell to the top row and adds the result to the total count. This ensures that all submatrices ending at the current cell are counted correctly. Finally, the total count of submatrices with all ones is returned. 

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(m * n * min(m, n)), which is feasible given the constraints of the problem. However, it may not be the most efficient solution for very large matrices. For more advanced solutions, you might consider using dynamic programming or prefix sums to optimize the calculation of submatrix counts.

class Solution:
    def largestEvenSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```
**Solution Explanation:** 
To solve this problem, we need to find the largest even sum of any subsequence of `nums` with a length of `k`. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Sort the Array**: We start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. This helps us easily access the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Identify the Largest Even and Odd Elements**: We iterate through the sorted array to identify the largest even and odd elements. We use two pointers, `even_ptr` and `odd_ptr`, to keep track of these elements.

3. **Construct the Subsequence**: We construct the subsequence by adding the largest even and odd elements alternately until we have selected `k` elements.

4. **Calculate the Sum**: Once we have constructed the subsequence, we calculate its sum. If the sum is even, we return it; otherwise, we return `-1`.

Here's the implementation of the above approach:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def largestEvenSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Sort the array in non-decreasing order
        nums.sort()
        
        # Initialize pointers for the largest even and odd elements
        even_ptr, odd_ptr = len(nums) - 1, len(nums) - 1
        
        # Construct the subsequence with the largest even and odd elements
        subseq = []
        for _ in range(k):
            if even_ptr >= 0 and odd_ptr >= 0:
                if nums[even_ptr] % 2 == 0:
                    subseq.append(nums[even_ptr])
                    even_ptr -= 1
                else:
                    subseq.append(nums[odd_ptr])
                    odd_ptr -= 1
            else:
                break
        
        # Calculate the sum of the constructed subsequence
        total_sum = sum(subseq)
        
        # Check if the sum is even
        if total_sum % 2 == 0:
            return total_sum
        else:
            return -1
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting**: We sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
- **Pointers**: We use two pointers, `even_ptr` and `odd_ptr`, to track the largest even and odd elements, respectively.
- **Subsequence Construction**:
ref:
def largest_even_sum(nums, k):
    evens = sorted([num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0], reverse=True)
    odds = sorted([num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0], reverse=True)

    sum = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        if evens:
            sum += evens.pop()

    for _ in range(0, k - 1, 2):
        if odds:
            first = odds.pop()
            if odds:
                second = odds.pop()
                sum += first + second

    return sum if sum % 2 == 0 else -1

**Solution:**

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize candidate and count
        candidate = None
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate through the array
        for num in nums:
            # If count is zero, update candidate
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            # Increment or decrement count based on the current number
            count += 1 if num == candidate else -1
        
        return candidate
```

This solution uses the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which efficiently finds the majority element in linear time and constant space. The algorithm works by maintaining a candidate and a count. It iterates through the array, updating the candidate and count based on whether the current element matches the candidate or not. If the count reaches zero, it updates the candidate to the current element. Finally, the candidate is returned as the majority element. This approach ensures that the majority element appears more than half the time in the array. **Note:** The algorithm assumes that the majority element always exists in the array, which is guaranteed by the problem statement. **Follow-up:** The solution provided already meets the constraints of linear time and constant space. However, if you need to handle cases where the majority element might not exist or if there are multiple majority elements, additional checks would be required. In such cases, the algorithm would need to be modified to handle ties or to return all majority elements. **Example Usage:**

```python
# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.majorityElement([3, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
print(solution.majorityElement([2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]))  # Output: 2
```

This solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find the majority element in the given array. **Constraints and Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. The algorithm processes each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size, as it only requires a few variables for tracking the candidate and count.

This solution is optimal for finding

    count = 0

This solution uses a graph to represent the relationships between the variables in the equations. Each variable is a node in the graph, and each edge represents a relationship between two variables with a specific ratio. The `dfs` function is used to perform a depth-first search starting from a node, and it checks if there is a path to another node with a specific ratio. If such a path is found, it means that there is a contradiction in the equations. The solution iterates over each equation and checks for contradictions using the `dfs` function. If a contradiction is found, the function returns `True`. If no contradictions are found after checking all equations, the function returns `False`. **End of Code**

This solution uses a sliding window approach with a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the current window. The window is expanded by moving the end pointer, and when the number of distinct characters exceeds two, the window is contracted by moving the start pointer. The maximum length of the valid window is recorded during this process. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(1) since the dictionary will contain at most three distinct characters. 

You can test this function with different strings to verify its correctness. Here are some examples:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct("eceba"))  # Output: 3
print(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct("ccaabbb"))  # Output: 5

class Solution:
    def isCousins(self, root: TreeNode, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
``` To solve the problem of determining if two nodes in a binary tree are cousins, we need to check if they have the same depth but different parents. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isCousins(self, root: TreeNode, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
        def dfs(node, parent, depth):
            if not node:
                return None
            if node.val == x or node.val == y:
                return (node, parent, depth)
            left = dfs(node.left, node, depth + 1)
            if left:
                return left
            right = dfs(node.right, node, depth + 1)
            if right:
                return right
        
        node_x, parent_x, depth_x = dfs(root, None, 0)
        node_y, parent_y, depth_y = dfs(root, None, 0)
        
        return depth_x == depth_y and parent_x != parent_y
```

### Explanation:

1. **DFS Function**: We define a helper function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search on the tree. This function takes three parameters: the current node, its parent, and the current depth.

2. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, we return `None`.

3. **Check Current Node**: If the current node's value matches either `x` or `y`, we return a tuple containing the node, its parent, and the current depth.

4. **Recursive Search**: We recursively call `dfs` for the left and right children of the current node, incrementing the depth by 1 each time.

5. **Return Results**: After the recursive calls, we return the results of the left and right searches. If either search finds a node with the desired value, it returns that result; otherwise, it returns `None`.

6. **Main Function**: In the `isCousins` method, we call `dfs` twice: once for `x` and once for `y`. We store the results in `node_x`, `parent_x`, `depth_x` for `x`, and `node_y`, `parent_y`, `depth_y` for `y`.

7. **Final Check**: Finally, we check if the depths of the two nodes are the same and if their parents are

``` 

This solution uses a dictionary (`seen`) to keep track of the indices of each number. As we iterate through the list, we check if the current number has been seen before. If it has, we compare the current index with the indices of the previous occurrences. If any of these indices satisfy the condition `abs(index - i) <= k`, we return `True`. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any such pair, we return `False`. This approach ensures that we efficiently find the required pair with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of indices in the dictionary. 

This solution works by maintaining a dictionary that stores the indices of each number encountered so far. As we iterate through the list, we check if the current number is already in the dictionary. If it is, we iterate through the list of indices for that number and check if any of them satisfy the condition `abs(index - i) <= k`. If we find such a pair, we return `True`.

```

This solution works as follows:

1. Split the input string `s` by `{` and `}` to separate the options within curly braces.

2. Iterate over each part of the split string:
   - If the part contains commas, split it into individual options.
   - If there are no commas, use the part as an option.

3. If this is the first part, initialize the result with the options.
   - For subsequent parts, generate all combinations of the current result and the options using the `product` function from the `itertools` module.

4. Sort the result and return it. This ensures that the words are returned in lexicographical order. ```python

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize two arrays, `left` and `right`, to store the number of consecutive non-"it" people to the left and right of each index, respectively.

2. We fill the `left` array by iterating from the second element to the last element. If the previous element is not "it", we increment the count; otherwise, we reset the count to 0.

3. We fill the `right` array by iterating from the second-to-last element to the first element. If the next element is not "it", we increment the count; otherwise, we reset the count to 0.

4. We initialize a variable `ans` to store the maximum number of people that the "it" people can catch.

5. We iterate through each index in the `team` array. If the current element is "it", we add the minimum of the `left` and `right` counts at that index to `ans`.

6. Finally, we return `ans`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the maximum number of people that the "it" people can catch by leveraging the precomputed arrays. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `team` array

This solution uses a sliding window approach to compare the frequency of characters in the current window of `s2` with the frequency of characters in `s1`. If they match, it means `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`. The window is adjusted by moving the `left` pointer when the window size exceeds the length of `s1`.

``` 

This solution generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using a bitmask approach. It checks each generated string against the input list `nums` and returns the first one that is not present. The `bin` function converts an integer to a binary string prefixed with '0b', so we slice off the first two characters and pad the result with zeros to ensure it has the correct length using `zfill`. This approach ensures that we find a unique binary string that is not in the input list.

1. **Max-Heap Initialization**: We convert the list of piles into a max-heap using negative values because Python's `heapq` module implements a min-heap. Each element in the heap represents the number of stones in a pile, with the largest number at the root.

2. **Operation Execution**: We perform the operation `k` times:
   - Pop the largest pile from the heap.
   - Remove `floor(largest_pile / 2)` stones from it.
   - Push the remaining stones back into the heap.

3. **Result Calculation**: After performing the operations, the sum of the remaining stones in the heap gives us the minimum possible total number of stones remaining. We convert the heap back to a list of positive values before summing them up.

This approach ensures that we always remove the largest pile first, minimizing the number of stones removed per operation. The time complexity is O(k log n), where n is the number of piles, due to the heap operations. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the heap. ```python
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minStoneSum(self, piles: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Convert the list into a max-heap
        max_heap = [-pile for pile in piles]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)
        
        # Perform the operation k times
        for _ in range(k):
            # Pop the largest pile
            largest_pile = -heapq.heappop(max_heap

    result = []

    while task_indices:
        while task_idx < len(task_indices) and tasks[task_indices[task_idx]][0] <= time:
            idx = task_indices[task_idx]
            min_heap.put((tasks[idx][1], idx))
            task_idx += 1

        if not min_heap.empty():
            processing_time, index = min_heap.get()
            time += processing_time
            result.append(index)
            task_indices.remove(index)
        elif task_idx < len(task_indices):
            time = max(time, tasks[task_indices[task_idx]][0])

    return result

        self.stack = self.stack[:len(self.stack)-index-1] + self.stack[len(self.stack)-index:]
        return max_value
```

This solution uses two stacks: `stack` to store the actual elements and `max_stack` to store the maximum elements encountered so far. The `push` method appends the element to both stacks if it is greater than or equal to the current maximum. The `pop` method removes the top element from both stacks if it matches the current maximum. The `top` method simply returns the top element of the `stack`. The `peekMax` method returns the top element of the `max_stack`. The `popMax` method finds the maximum element in the `stack`, removes it, and updates the `stack` to exclude this element. The time complexity of the `popMax` method is O(n) in the worst case due to the need to find the maximum element and remove it from the stack. However, since the `stack` is implemented using a list, the average time complexity of the `popMax` method is O(log n) due to the use of the `index` method, which has a time complexity of O(n). The time complexity of the other methods is O(1). The space complexity of the solution is O(n) due to the use of two stacks. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

**Code solution:** 
 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        max_left = [0] * n
        min_right = [0] * n
        
        # Calculate the maximum value from the left side
        max_left[0] = arr[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_left[i] = max(max_left[i - 1], arr[i])
        
        # Calculate the minimum value from the right side
        min_right[n - 1] = arr[n - 1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            min_right[i] = min(min_right[i + 1], arr[i])
        
        # Count the number of chunks
        chunks = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if max_left[i] <= min_right[i]:
                chunks += 1
        
        return chunks
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize two arrays, `max_left` and `min_right`, both of size `n`. These arrays will store the maximum value from the left side and the minimum value from the right side up to each index, respectively.

2. We populate the `max_left` array by iterating through the array from left to right and keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far.

3. We populate the `min_right` array by iterating through the array from right to left and keeping track of the minimum value encountered so far.

4. We iterate through the array again and count the number of chunks where the maximum value on the left side is less than or equal to the minimum value on the right side. This indicates that the subarray can be split into a chunk without affecting the sorted order.

5. Finally, we return the count of chunks. ```python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        max_left = [0] * n
        min_right = [0] * n
        
        # Calculate the maximum value from the left side
        max_left[0] = arr[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_left[i] = max(max_left[i - 1

```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        res = []
        self.backtrack(s, [], res)
        return res
    
    def backtrack(self, s, path, res):
        if not s:
            res.append(path[:])

                self.backtrack(s[i:], path, res)
                path.pop()
```

**Explanation:** 

The solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string `s`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `res` to store the result and a helper function `backtrack` to perform the backtracking.

2. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function takes three parameters: the remaining string `s`, the current path `path`, and the result list `res`.

3. **Base Case**: If the remaining string `s` is empty, it means we have successfully partitioned the entire string into palindromic substrings. We append a copy of the current path to `res`.

4. **Recursive Case**: We iterate through the string `s` to find all possible palindromic substrings. For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome using slicing (`s[:i] == s[:i][::-1]`). If it is a palindrome, we add it to the current path and recursively call `backtrack` with the remaining string `s[i:]`. After the recursive call, we remove the last added substring from the path to explore other possibilities.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the list `res` containing all possible palindrome partitions.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible partitions and find all valid palindromic substrings. The time complexity is exponential due to the backtracking nature, but it is manageable for the given constraints. Here's the complete implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        res = []
        
        def backtrack(start, path):
            if start == len(s):
                res.append(path[:])
                return
            
            for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                if s[start:end] == s[start:end][::-1]:
                    path.append(s[start:end
ref:
def isPalindrome(s, start, end):
    while start < end:
        if s[start] != s[end]:
            return False
        start += 1
        end -= 1
    return True

def dfs(s, start, results, current):
    if start == len(s):
        results.append(current[:])
        return
    
    for end in range(start, len(s)):
        if isPalindrome(s, start, end):
            current.append(s[start:end+1])
            dfs(s, end + 1, results, current)
            current.pop()

def partition(s):
    results = []
    dfs(s, 0, results, [])
    return results

```


To solve the problem of removing an invalid node and all nodes underneath it in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:

```python
class Solution:
    def correctBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Dictionary to keep track of parent-child relationships
        parent_child_map = {}
        
        def dfs(node, parent):
            if not node:
                return
            
            # Add the current node to the parent-child map
            parent_child_map[node] = parent
            
            # Recursively process the left and right children
            dfs(node.left, node)
            dfs(node.right, node)
        
        # Perform DFS to build the parent-child map
        dfs(root, None)
        
        # Check for invalid nodes and remove them
        for node, parent in parent_child_map.items():
            if node.right and parent_child_map.get(node.right) == node:
                parent.right = None
                break
        
        return root
```

### Explanation:

1. **Parent-Child Map Construction**: We use a dictionary `parent_child_map` to store each node and its parent. This allows us to easily trace back the path from any node to its ancestors.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We perform a DFS to populate the `parent_child_map` with all nodes and their respective parents.

3. **Identify Invalid Node**: After constructing the map, we iterate through the map to find the invalid node. An invalid node is identified when the right child of a node is the same node as the node itself.

4. **Remove Invalid Node**: Once the invalid node is found, we set its parent's right child to `None` to effectively remove the entire subtree rooted at the invalid node.

5. **Return the Corrected Tree**: Finally, we return the root of the corrected binary tree.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and remove the invalid node and all nodes underneath it, maintaining the integrity of the binary tree

This solution works as follows:

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We perform a DFS to calculate the distance from the root to each node. This is done using a recursive function that updates the distance for each node.

3. **Closest Node on Path**: We define a helper function `closestNodeOnPath` that finds the closest node to the given node on the path from `start` to `end`. This function handles cases where the start and end nodes are the same, or when the start and end nodes are different.

4. **Process Each Query**: We process each query by calling the `closestNodeOnPath` function and storing the result in the `result` list.

5. **Return Result**: Finally,

class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```
**Explanation:**

The problem requires counting the number of distinct great partitions of an array `nums` into two ordered groups such that the sum of elements in each group is greater than or equal to `k`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently checking combinations of elements for the required partition sums.

2. **Calculate Total Sum**: Compute the total sum of the array `nums`.

3. **Initialize Variables**: Use variables to keep track of the number of great partitions, the current sum of the first group, and the number of ways to achieve a certain sum using dynamic programming.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a dictionary `dp` to store the number of ways to achieve each sum from `0` to `k-1` using the elements of the array.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to achieve a sum of `0` (using no elements).

5. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element `num` in the sorted array:
     - Update the total sum of the first group by adding `num`.
     - Check if the current total sum is less than `k`. If so, update the result by adding the number of ways to achieve the remaining sum (`k - total_sum`) using the current element.
     - Update the dynamic programming dictionary `dp` to include the current element.

6. **Result Calculation**: The result is the total number of ways to partition the array into two groups such that the sum of each group is greater than or equal to `k`.

7. **Return the Result**: Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        nums.sort()
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        
        if total_sum < 2 * k:
            return 0
        
        dp = {0: 1}
        result = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            total_sum += num
            result = (result + dp.get(total_sum - k, 0)) % MOD
            
            for j in range(k -
ref:
def countPartitions(nums, k):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    n = len(nums)
    mod = 1000000007

    if total_sum < k * 2:
        return 0

    dp = [1] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(1, k):
        for j in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            dp[j] = (dp[j] * j + dp[j - 1]) % mod

    result = 0

    for i in range(n - 1):
        total_sum -= nums[i]
        if total_sum >= k:
            result = (result + dp[i + 1]) % mod

    return result

        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if char == '*':
                if stack:

            else:
                stack.append(char)
        return ''.join(stack)
``` 

This solution uses a stack to keep track of characters. When a star is encountered, if the stack is not empty, the last character is popped from the stack. If a non-star character is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. Finally, the stack is joined to form the result string. This approach ensures that the stars are removed correctly and efficiently. 

**Explanation:**

1. We initialize an empty stack.
2. We iterate over each character in the input string `s`.
3. If the character is a star (`'*'`), we check if the stack is not empty. If it's not empty, we pop the last character from the stack.
4. If the character is not a star, we push it onto the stack.
5. After processing all characters, we join the characters in the stack to form the result string and return it. 

This method ensures that all stars are removed correctly and efficiently, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem. 

**Example Usage:**

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.removeStars("leet*cod*e"))  # Output: "lecoe"
print(solution.removeStars("erase*****"))  # Output: ""
``` 

This code will handle the given examples and any other valid input according to the problem's specifications. 

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

- The input string `s` will always be generated such that the operation is always possible.
- The operation can be performed on `s`.
- The function should return a unique string result.

This solution efficiently handles the removal of stars and constructs the final string without any duplicates. 

**Time Complexity:**

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we process each character in the string exactly once.
- The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where all characters in the string are stars. This is because the stack could potentially hold all characters if no non-star characters are encountered. However, in practice, the stack size will be much smaller due to the nature of the problem.

This solution uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string. It then calculates the number of characters that appear an odd number of times. The length of the longest palindrome is determined by subtracting this count from the total length of the string, plus one if there is at least one character with an odd count. This ensures that the palindrome can include one character with an odd count in the middle, while still allowing all other characters to appear an even number of times on either side.

        # Get the day of the week as a string
        return date.strftime("%A")
```


This code uses Python's built-in `datetime` module to create a `datetime` object for the given date and then uses the `strftime` method to get the day of the week as a string. The `%A` format specifier returns the full name of the day of the week. 

You can call this function with the desired date to get the corresponding day of the week as a string. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.dayOfTheWeek(31, 8, 2019))  # Output: "Saturday"
print(solution.dayOfTheWeek(18, 7, 1999))  # Output: "Sunday"

        # Iterate over the characters in the string
        for char in s:
            # Update the current character and its count
            current_char = char
            current_count += 1
            
            # While the current character is the smallest and the current count is greater than zero,
            # add the current character to the result string and decrement its count
            while current_char == min(char_count) and current_count > 0:
                result.append(current_char)
                char_count[current_char] -= 1
                current_count -= 1
        
        return ''.join(result)
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

2. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the final result string.

3. We initialize two variables, `current_char` and `current_count`, to keep track of the current character and its count in the string.

4. We iterate over each character in the string `s`:
   - We update the `current_char` and `current_count` variables to reflect the current character and its count.
   - We use a while loop to add the current character to the result string and decrement its count as long as the current character is the smallest character and its count is greater than zero.

5. Finally, we join the characters in the `result` list into a single string and return it. This string represents the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper. 

This approach ensures that we always add the smallest character to the result string, and we handle ties by adding the character with the smallest index. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, and the space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

        self.prev = root
        
        self.dfs(root.right, p)
```

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary search tree. The DFS function keeps track of the previous node (`self.prev`) and the current node (`root`). When it encounters the node `p`, it checks if the previous node is `p`. If so, it sets the `self.successor` to the current node. Finally, it continues the traversal to find the next node with a greater value than `p`. If no such node is found, the `self.successor` remains `None`. The `inorderSuccessor` method returns the `self.successor` after the traversal. Here is the complete solution with the given code:
```python
class Solution:
    def inorderSuccessor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        self.successor = None

**Code solution:**

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minIncrementForUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort the array
        nums.sort()

        moves = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted array

            # If the current number is less than or equal to the previous number
            if nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
                # Calculate the number of moves needed to make the current number unique
                moves += nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1
                # Update the current number to be one more than the previous number
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1
        
        return moves
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort the Array**: The first step is to sort the array. Sorting helps in easily identifying the smallest number that can be used to make the current number unique.

2. **Initialize Moves**: We initialize a variable `moves` to keep track of the total number of moves required.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element.

4. **Check for Uniqueness**: For each element, if it is less than or equal to the previous element, it means the current element cannot be made unique with the smallest possible number. We calculate the number of moves needed to make the current element unique and update the current element accordingly.

5. **Update Moves**: We add the calculated number of moves to the `moves` counter.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the total number of moves required to make all numbers in the array unique. 

This approach ensures that we always use the smallest possible number to make each subsequent number unique, thus minimizing the total number of moves. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are modifying the input array in place. 

This solution handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement effectively.

``` 
This solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to mark the connected component that contains the specified cell with a negative color value. It then iterates through the grid to replace the negative color values with the original color value, except for the border cells, which remain unchanged. This effectively colors the border of the connected component. The time complexity is O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid, and the space complexity is O(m * n) due to the recursion stack.

This solution works as follows:

1. We use a dictionary `seen` to keep track of the indices of words that have the same sorted character sequence.
2. For each word in the input list, we sort its characters and use the sorted sequence as a key in the `seen` dictionary.
3. We append the index of the word to the list associated with its sorted key.
4. We then iterate over the input list again and for each word, we sort its characters and check if the sorted sequence matches any key in the `seen` dictionary.
5. If a match is found, we check if the index of the word is the smallest among the indices for that key. If it is, we append the word to the result list and remove the smallest index from the list associated with that key.
6. Finally, we return the result list. ``` ``` ```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def removeAnagrams(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:

**Code solution:**

class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        # Convert numbers to strings
        nums_str = [str(num) for num in nums]

            return '0'
        
        # Join sorted strings
        return ''.join(nums_str)
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Convert each number in the list to a string for easy comparison.
2. Define a custom comparison function `compare` that compares two strings `x` and `y` based on whether `xy` is greater than `yx`. This ensures that when sorting, larger numbers come first.
3. Use the `sort` method with the custom comparison function to sort the list of strings.
4. Handle the edge case where all numbers are zero by returning '0' directly.
5. Join the sorted strings to form the largest possible number and return it. 

This approach ensures that the numbers are arranged in the order that forms the largest possible number when concatenated. **End of code** ```python``` ```python

This solution works as follows:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `None`, return `None` because the key was not found.

2. **Search for the Key**:
   - If the current node's value is equal to the key, proceed to delete the node.
   - If the current node's value is less than the key, recursively delete the node in the right subtree.
   - If the current node's value is greater than the key, recursively delete the node in the left subtree.

3. **Delete the Node**:
   - **Case 1**: If the node has no children, simply return `None`.
   - **Case 2**: If the node has one child, return the non-null child.
   - **Case 3**: If the node has two children:
     - Find the minimum value in the right subtree using the `findMin` helper function.
     - Replace the current node's value with the minimum value.
     - Recursively delete the minimum node from the right subtree.

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time. The DP table `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of skips needed to reach the `i-th` road with `j` skips. The solution iterates over each road and each possible number of skips, updating the DP table based on whether to skip the current road or not. Finally, it checks if the minimum number of skips needed to reach the last road within the given hours is less than or equal to the total time available. If it is, the solution returns the number of skips; otherwise

This implementation uses a dictionary to store the points and their frequencies. The `add` method increments the frequency of a point, and the `count` method calculates the number of axis-aligned squares that can be formed with the given point as the center. It checks for all points with the same x-coordinate and calculates the side length of the square using the absolute difference between the y-coordinates. It then multiplies the frequencies of the four points involved in the square to get the number of squares that can be formed. The time complexity of the `count` method is O(n), where n is the number of points in the data structure. The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the storage of the points and their frequencies.

``` 

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `minMaxGame` that takes a list of integers `nums` and applies the described algorithm to find the last remaining number. The method uses a while loop to repeatedly halve the length of the list, applying the min-max game logic, until only one number remains. The final result is returned as the output. 

Let's verify the correctness of this solution with the provided examples:

**Example 1:**
```python
nums = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 8, 2, 2]
print(Solution().minMaxGame(nums))  # Output: 1
```
This should return 1, as explained in the problem statement.

**Example 2:**
```python
nums = [3]
print(Solution().minMaxGame(nums))  # Output: 3
```
This should return 3, as there is only one element in the list, and it is the last remaining number.

The solution works correctly for both examples and adheres to the constraints specified in the problem. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!

This solution works as follows:

1. Build the adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. Use DFS to find all connected components in the graph.
3. Count the number of infected nodes in each component.
4. Find the component with the maximum number of unique infected nodes.
5. Return the node with the smallest index in the best component.

This approach ensures that we find the node that, if removed, would minimize the number of infected nodes in the entire network. Here's the complete code for the solution:

    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len(colors) - 1):
            if colors[i - 1] == colors[i] == colors[i + 1]:
                count += 1
        return count % 2 == 1
```

The logic is as follows:
- Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
- Iterate through the string `colors` from index 1 to `len(colors) - 2`.
- For each character at index `i`, check if it is the same as the characters at indices `i-1` and `i+1`.
- If it is, increment the counter `count`.
- After the loop, return `True` if the counter `count` is odd, otherwise return `False`. This is because Alice wins if the number of moves she can make is odd, and Bob wins if the number of moves he can make is even. Since Alice moves first, if the number of moves she can make is odd, she wins. If the number of moves she can make is even, Bob wins. Therefore, we return `True` if the counter `count` is odd, otherwise we return `False`. 

This solution works in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string `colors`, and it uses O(1) space complexity. It efficiently determines the winner of the game based on the given conditions. Here is the implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len(colors) - 1):

                count += 1
        return count % 2 == 1

``` 

This solution iterates through each character in the string `s`. It maintains a `current_depth` variable to track the current level of nesting and a `max_depth` variable to store the maximum depth encountered. When encountering an opening parenthesis `'('`, it increments the `current_depth` and updates `max_depth` if the current depth is greater. When encountering a closing parenthesis `')'`, it decrements the `current_depth`. Finally, it returns the `max_depth` after processing all characters in the string. This approach ensures that the nesting depth is accurately calculated for any valid parentheses string. 

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. The solution processes each character exactly once.
**Space Complexity**: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The solution does not use any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

            count = 0
            left = 0
            right = n - 1

            # Use two pointers to find pairs with incident edges greater than query
            while left < right:
                if incident_edges[left] + incident_edges[right] > query:
                    count += right - left
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    left += 1

            result[i] = count

        return result
```
    
    This solution works as follows:
1. **Create Adjacency List**: We create an adjacency list to represent the graph using the given edges.
2. **Count Incident Edges**: We count the number of incident edges for each node and store them in the `incident_edges` list.
3. **Sort Incident Edges**: We sort the `incident_edges` list to facilitate the two-pointer approach.
4. **Initialize Result Array**: We initialize the result array to store the number of pairs for each query.
5. **Iterate Over Each Query**: For each query, we use two pointers to find pairs of nodes with incident edges greater than the query value.
6. **Two-Pointer Approach**: We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, and iterate them towards each other. If the sum of incident edges at the two pointers is greater than the query, we count all pairs between these two pointers and move the `right` pointer to the left. Otherwise, we move the `left` pointer to the right.
7. **Store Result**: We store the count of pairs for each query in the result array 47%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹     | 14/30 [02:49<03:13, 12.11s/it]

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Depth Calculation**: The `dfs` function calculates the depth of each node in the tree. It recursively traverses the left and right subtrees, updating the maximum depth found so far. When the depths of the left and right subtrees are equal, the current node is added to the `deepest` list.

2. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**: The `lca` function finds the LCA of the deepest nodes. It recursively searches for the nodes in the left and right subtrees. If both nodes are found in different subtrees, the current node is the LCA. If one node is found in a subtree and the other is found in the other subtree, the current node is also the LCA. If neither node is found in either subtree, the search continues in the appropriate subtree.

3. **Main Function**: The `lcaDeepestLeaves` function initializes the `deepest` list and calls the `dfs` function to calculate the depths of all nodes. If there is only one deepest node, it returns that node. Otherwise, it calls the `lca` function to find the LCA of the deepest nodes and returns it.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify the lowest common ancestor

This solution uses two heaps to maintain the order of elements in the sliding window. The `min_heap` stores the smaller half of the elements, and the `max_heap` stores the larger half. The median is calculated by taking the average of the root elements of the two heaps when they are of equal size, or the root element of the `min_heap` when the heaps are of different sizes. The solution ensures that the heaps remain balanced and the median is calculated efficiently in each iteration of the sliding window. ```python

from typing import List
import heapq

        # Count the number of spaces and words in the text
        spaces = text.count(' ')

        result += ' '.join(words)
        result += ' ' * remaining_spaces
        
        return result
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Count Spaces and Words**: Use the `count` method to count the number of spaces in the text and the `split` method to split the text into words.

2. **Handle Single Word Case**: If there is only one word, distribute all spaces at the end of the word.

3. **Calculate Spaces Between Words**: Determine the number of spaces to place between each pair of words by dividing the total number of spaces by the number of gaps between words (`len(words) - 1`). Use the modulo operation to determine if there are any extra spaces.

4. **Construct Result String**: Build the result string by placing the calculated number of spaces between each word and appending any remaining spaces at the end.

This approach ensures that the spaces are distributed as evenly as possible between the words, and any leftover spaces are appended at the end. 

**Example Usage**:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.reorderSpaces("  this   is  a sentence  "))  # Output: "this   is   a   sentence "
print(solution.reorderSpaces(" practice   makes   perfect "))  # Output: "practice   makes   perfect  "

This solution uses a prefix sum approach to efficiently count the number of subarrays with a sum equal to the goal. It maintains a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` to keep track of the frequency of each prefix sum encountered. As it iterates through the array, it updates the prefix sum and checks if there exists a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals the goal. If such a prefix sum exists, it adds the corresponding count to the result. Finally, it returns the total count of such subarrays. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

``` 

This solution works by first defining two helper functions: `xor_count`, which counts the number of differing bits between two numbers, and `xor_range`, which calculates the number of pairs of numbers in the range `[i, j]` whose XOR values fall within the specified range `[low, high]`. The main function then iterates over all pairs of indices `(i, j)` and adds the result of `xor_range(nums[i], high) - xor_range(nums[i], low - 1)` to the total count. This approach ensures that all possible pairs are considered and the count is accurate. Here's the complete implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, nums: List[int], low: int, high: int) -> int:
        def xor_count(i, j):

        return sum(xor_range(nums[i], high) - xor_range(nums[i], low - 1) for i in range(len(nums)))
```

This solution efficiently counts the number of nice pairs by leveraging bitwise operations and prefix sums. The `xor_count` function helps determine the number of differing bits between two numbers, while `xor_range` calculates the number of pairs whose XOR values fall within the specified range. The main function iterates over all pairs of indices and uses these helper functions to compute the desired count. This approach ensures that all possible pairs are considered and the count is accurate. Here's the complete implementation:

**Solution Explanation:** 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxIceCream(self, costs: List[int], coins: int) -> int:
        # Sort the costs in ascending order
        costs.sort()
        
        # Initialize the count of ice cream bars bought
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted costs
        for cost in costs:
            # If the current cost is greater than the remaining coins, break the loop
            if cost > coins:
                break
            
            # Add the cost to the remaining coins
            coins -= cost
            
            # Increment the count of ice cream bars bought
            count += 1
        
        # Return the maximum number of ice cream bars bought
        return count
``` 

This solution works by first sorting the costs of the ice cream bars in ascending order. It then iterates through the sorted costs, subtracting the cost of each ice cream bar from the remaining coins and incrementing the count of ice cream bars bought until the remaining coins are less than the cost of the next ice cream bar. Finally, it returns the maximum number of ice cream bars bought. This approach ensures that the boy buys as many ice cream bars as possible with the given coins. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space. 

If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask! Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. Happy coding!

    def countVowels(self, word: str) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(word)):
            ans += (i + 1) * (len(word) - i)
        return ans
```
This solution works by iterating through each character in the word and calculating the number of substrings that contain that character as the first vowel. The formula `(i + 1) * (len(word) - i)` gives the number of substrings that contain the character as the first vowel, where `i` is the index of the character in the word. The result is summed over all characters in the word to get the total number of substrings that contain at least one vowel. This approach avoids the need to generate and process all possible substrings, making it efficient for large input sizes. Note that this solution does not account for the fact that a character can be part of multiple substrings that contain the same number of vowels, as required by the problem statement. To handle this case, we could use a more complex algorithm that keeps track of the number of substrings that contain a given number of vowels, but this would increase the complexity of the solution. Here is an alternative solution that uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of substrings that contain a given number of vowels:
```python
class Solution:
    def countVowels(self, word: str) -> int:
        vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
        dp = [[0] * (len(word) + 1) for _ in range(len(word) + 1)]
        for i in range(len(word)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(word) + 1):
                if word[j - 1] in vowels:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(word)):
            ans += (i + 1) * dp[0][i + 1]
        return ans
```

This solution uses a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of substrings that contain the first `i` characters of the word and end at the `j`th character. We initialize `dp` with zeros and iterate through each character in the word, updating the DP array based on whether the current character is a vowel

        return max_operations if max_operations != -1 else -1
```
    
This solution iterates through each round of customers, calculating the profit and operations performed. It keeps track of the maximum profit and corresponding operations. If there are remaining customers after all rounds, it calculates the additional operations needed to serve them and updates the maximum profit and operations accordingly. Finally, it returns the maximum operations needed to achieve the maximum profit, or -1 if no positive profit can be achieved.

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Construction**: We first build an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - We use two depth-first search (DFS) functions:
     - `dfs(node, parent)`: This function calculates the total distance from the root to all nodes in the subtree rooted at `node`. It also counts the number of nodes in the subtree.
     - `dfs2(node, parent)`: This function calculates the total distance from `node` to all other nodes in the tree. It uses the precomputed distances and counts from the `dfs` function.

3. **Initialization**: We initialize two lists, `distances` and `count`, to store the distances and counts of nodes in the subtree, respectively.

4. **First DFS**: We start the first DFS from the root (node 0) and calculate the total distance and count for each subtree.

5. **Second DFS**: We start the second DFS from the root again and update the distances for each node based on the distances and counts from the first DFS.

6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `distances` list, which contains the sum of distances from each node to all other nodes. ```python

This solution works as follows:

1. **Hash Function**: We define a `get_hash` function that takes a list of directory names and returns a hash based on the sorted order of the directory names. This helps us identify identical directories.

2. **Graph Construction**: We build a graph where each node represents a directory and edges represent the hierarchy between directories. We also maintain a hash table to store the hash of each directory.

3. **DFS for Duplication Check**: We use a depth-first search (DFS) to check if any node has duplicate children. If a node has duplicate children, we mark it as a potential duplicate.

4. **Identify Duplicates**: We iterate through the graph and use DFS to identify nodes with duplicate children.

5. **Remove Duplicates**: Finally, we remove the duplicate folders from the result list and return it.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and remove duplicate folders in the file system. The time complexity is O(n * m log m), where n is the number

   - If the node is `None`, it returns `0`.
   - It recursively calculates the heights of the left and right subtrees.
   - If either subtree is unbalanced (i.e., returns `-1`), it immediately returns `-1`.
   - It checks if the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees is more than 1. If so, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum height of the left and right subtrees plus one.

2. **Main Function (`isBalanced`)**:
   - It calls the helper function `dfs` on the root of the tree.
   - If `dfs` returns a value other than `-1`, it means the tree is balanced, and it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This approach ensures that the tree is checked for balance in a single pass, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

        return min(dp)
```


This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize the `dp` array with the first row of the matrix, as this is the base case for our dynamic programming approach.

2. We iterate through the rest of the rows of the matrix, starting from the second row.

3. For each cell in the current row, we calculate the minimum path sum by considering the three possible cells above it (i.e., the cell directly above, the cell diagonally left, and the cell diagonally right).

4. We use the `min` function to find the minimum path sum among these three possibilities.

5. We update the `dp` array with the minimum path sums for the current row.

6. After iterating through all the rows, we return the minimum path sum from the last row of the `dp` array, as this represents the minimum path sum from the top of the matrix to the bottom.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible paths from the top of the matrix to the bottom and find the one with the minimum sum. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix, as we need to iterate through each cell of the matrix. The space complexity is O(n) as we only need to store the current row of the `dp`

``` 

This solution uses a hash map to keep track of the prefix sums encountered so far. As we iterate through the linked list, we update the prefix sum and check if it has been seen before. If it has, it means there is a subarray with a sum of zero, and we remove it by adjusting the pointers in the linked list. We continue this process until there are no more subarrays with a sum of zero. The resulting linked list is returned as the output.

                seen.add(substring)
        
        return len(seen) == 2 ** k
```

The solution works as follows:

1. We initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of all unique binary codes of length `k` that we encounter in the string `s`.

2. We iterate through the string `s` using a sliding window of size `k`. For each window, we extract the substring and check if it has already been encountered in the set `seen`.

3. If the substring is not in the set `seen`, we add it to the set.

4. After iterating through the entire string, we check if the size of the set `seen` is equal to `2 ** k`. This is because there are `2 ** k` unique binary codes of length `k` that can be formed using `k` bits.

5. If the size of the set `seen` is equal to `2 ** k`, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * k) and a space complexity of O(2 ** k), where n is the length of the string `s`. However, since the value of `k` is limited to 20, the space complexity is manageable. Let me know if you have any questions!

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the `start` and `target` strings, respectively.

2. Skip leading underscores in both strings using a while loop.

3. If both pointers reach the end of their respective strings, return `True` because the strings are identical.

4. If one pointer reaches the end, return `False` because the other string has more characters.

5. If the characters at the current positions are not the same, return `False` because the strings cannot be made identical.

6. Check the direction of movement:
   - If the character is `'L'`, ensure that the target index `j` is less than or equal to the start index `i`.
   - If the character is `'R'`, ensure that the target index `j` is greater than or equal to the start index `i`.

7. Move both pointers if the conditions are satisfied.

8. If all checks pass, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

This solution checks if the array is either monotonically increasing or decreasing by iterating through the array once. It uses two boolean flags, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to track whether the array is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If either flag remains `True` after checking all elements, the array is monotonic. Otherwise, it is not. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

```


This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. We maintain a dictionary `nodes` where the keys are tuples representing the vertical and horizontal positions of the nodes, and the values are lists of node values at those positions.

We use a queue to perform the BFS. For each node, we enqueue its left and right children with adjusted vertical and horizontal positions. After processing all nodes, we sort the dictionary items by vertical position and then by horizontal position. Finally, we extract the sorted node values into the result list and return it. This ensures that the nodes are traversed in the correct order and grouped by their vertical and horizontal positions.

This solution works as follows:

1. Convert the input arrays `arr1` and `arr2` to integers in base -2 using Python's built-in `int` function with a base of -2.

2. Add the two resulting integers.

3. Convert the sum back to a base -2 array. This involves repeatedly taking the remainder when dividing by -2 and handling negative remainders by converting them to positive remainders and adjusting the result accordingly.

4. Reverse the resulting array to get the correct order of digits.

5. Return the resulting array. If the result is 0, return `[0]` as specified. 

This approach ensures that the result is correctly represented in base -2 and handles all edge cases as specified in the problem constraints.

        min_error = sum(float_prices) - target
        
        # Calculate the maximum rounding error
        max_error = sum(math.ceil(price) for price in float_prices) - target
        
        # Check if the minimum rounding error is within the range
        if min_error > max_error:

        # Return the minimum rounding error as a string with three decimal places
        return f"{min_error:.3f}"
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Convert the input prices from strings to floats for easier manipulation.
2. Calculate the total cost of rounding down all prices.
3. Determine the remaining target after rounding down.
4. If the remaining target is negative, it means it's impossible to meet the target, so return "-1".
5. Calculate the minimum rounding error by subtracting the target from the sum of the original prices.
6. Calculate the maximum rounding error by subtracting the target from the sum of the ceiling values of the original prices.
7. Check if the minimum rounding error is within the range of the maximum rounding error. If not, return "-1".
8. Return the minimum rounding error as a string with three decimal places. If the minimum rounding error is greater than the maximum rounding error, return "-1". Otherwise, return the minimum rounding error formatted to three decimal places. ```python

This solution works as follows:

2. Initialize `ans` with the value of `nums[k]`, which is the minimum value in the initial window.

3. Use a while loop to expand the window to the left as long as the previous element is greater than or equal to the current element at `k`. Update the minimum value and calculate the score for the current window.

4. Use another while loop to expand the window to the right as long as the next element is greater than or equal to the current element at `k`. Update the minimum value and calculate the score for the current window.

5. Return the maximum score found during the expansion process. ``` ``` ```python

        return reverse_list(reversed_head)
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Reverse the List**: The function `reverse_list` reverses the linked list to make it easier to handle the addition from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

2. **Add One**: Start from the least significant digit (head of the reversed list) and add one to it. If the sum is greater than or equal to 10, set the current digit to the remainder of the division by 10 and carry over the quotient to the next digit.

3. **Handle Carry**: Continue this process until there is no carry left. If there is still a carry after processing all digits, create a new node with the carry and attach it to the head of the reversed list.

4. **Reverse Back**: Finally, reverse the list back to its original order and return the modified head. If no carry is needed, the original head remains unchanged. 

This approach ensures that the addition is done correctly without affecting the relative order of the digits.

            return 0
        
        # Return the length of the unsorted subarray
        return end - start + 1
```


This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `min_val` and `max_val` to infinity and negative infinity respectively. Also, initialize `start` and `end` to -1.

2. Iterate through the array from left to right. For each element, update `max_val` to be the maximum value encountered so far. If the current element is less than `max_val`, update `end` to the current index.

3. Iterate through the array from right to left. For each element, update `min_val` to be the minimum value encountered so far. If the current element is greater than `min_val`, update `start` to the current index.

4. If `start` and `end` remain -1, it means the array is already sorted, so return 0.

5. Otherwise, return the length of the unsorted subarray, which is `end - start + 1`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, and a space complexity of O(1). It does not use any additional data structures. The solution works by finding the minimum and maximum values in the unsorted subarray and then using these values to determine the start and end indices of the subarray. The length of the subarray is then calculated by

    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)

        # Join the sorted teams into a single string
        return ''.join(sorted_teams)
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Check for Single Vote**: If there's only one vote, return the first team immediately.

2. **Initialize Votes Dictionary**: Use a `defaultdict` to store the total votes for each team. The dictionary maps each team to a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of votes in a particular position.

3. **Count Votes**: Iterate through each vote and update the vote counts for each team in the `team_votes` dictionary.

4. **Sort Teams**: Sort the teams based on the total votes. The sorting is done primarily by the sum of votes in descending order (to ensure the team with the most votes comes first). If two teams have the same number of votes, they are sorted alphabetically by their team name.

5. **Join Sorted Teams**: Join the sorted team names into a single string and return it. 

This approach ensures that the teams are ranked according to the specified criteria, and it handles all the given constraints effectively.

            result.append(level_values)
        
        return result
```

This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree level by level. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Check if the root is `None`. If it is, return an empty list since there are no nodes to traverse.
   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the level order traversal results.
   - Use a `deque` called `queue` to facilitate the BFS traversal. Start by adding the root node to the queue.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - While the queue is not empty, process each level of the tree.
   - Determine the number of nodes in the current level (`level_size`) using `len(queue)`.
   - Create an empty list `level_values` to store the values of nodes at the current level.

3. **Processing Nodes at Current Level**:
   - For each node in the current level, dequeue it from the front of the queue.
   - Append the node's value to `level_values`.
   - If the node has a left child, enqueue it.
   - If the node has a right child, enqueue it.

4. **Store Level Values**:
   - After processing all nodes in the current level, append the `level_values` list to the `result` list.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Once all levels have been processed, return the `result` list containing the level order traversal of the binary tree. 

This approach ensures that nodes are processed level by level, and the values are collected in the correct order for each level. The use of a queue allows for efficient level-by-level traversal.

This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path in the grid. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Check if the starting cell `(0, 0)` or the ending cell `(n-1, n-1)` is blocked (`grid[0][0] == 1` or `grid[-1][-1] == 1`). If so, return `-1` because there is no clear path.
   - Define the number of rows `n` and the possible movement directions in all eight directions.
   - Use a queue `q` to perform BFS and a set `visited` to keep track of visited cells.
   - Initialize `steps` to 1, representing the initial position.

2. **BFS Loop**:
   - While the queue is not empty, process all cells at the current level (`sz`).
   - For each cell, check if it is the destination cell `(n-1, n-1)

**Code solution:**

        # Pop nodes from the stack and print their values
        while stack:

```

This solution uses a stack to reverse the order of nodes in the linked list. By pushing each node onto the stack during traversal, we can then pop nodes from the stack and print their values in reverse order. This approach ensures that we do not modify the linked list and operates within the constraints of the given API. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the stack used to store nodes. Note that the follow-up questions about constant space complexity and linear time complexity with less than linear space complexity are more challenging and may require additional considerations or optimizations. ```python

This solution uses an in-order traversal of the BST to visit nodes in ascending order. It keeps track of the previous node's value (`self.prev`) and calculates the minimum difference between the current node's value and the previous node's value. The minimum difference found during the traversal is returned as the result.

            res += (count * (count + 1)) // 2
            res %= mod
        return res
```


### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `res` to store the result and `mod` to 10^9 + 7, which is used to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.

2. **Iterate through the string**: We iterate through the string using a for loop.

3. **Count consecutive identical characters**: For each character, we count how many consecutive identical characters are present. We use a variable `count` to keep track of this.

4. **Calculate the number of homogenous substrings**: Once we have counted the number of consecutive identical characters, we can calculate the number of homogenous substrings that can be formed from these characters. This is given by the formula `(count * (count + 1)) // 2`.

5. **Update the result**: We add the calculated number of homogenous substrings to `res`. We take the result modulo `mod` to ensure it does not overflow.

6. **Return the result**: Finally, we return the result.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of homogenous substrings in the string `s`. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we only need to traverse the string once. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space. 
```python
```python
class Solution:
    def countHomogenous(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
        for i in range(len(s)):
            count = 1
            while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                count += 1
                i += 1
            res += (count * (count + 1)) // 2
            res %= mod
        return res

        longest_group = max(groups, key=len)

                # If the first character of the current group is greater, break the loop
                break
        
        return ''.join(result)
```

This solution works by grouping consecutive identical characters in the string `s`. It then finds the longest group of characters and appends the remaining characters from the longest group to the result. If the first character of the longest group is greater than the first character of the current group, it appends the remaining characters from the current group to the result. If the first character of the current group is greater, it breaks the loop and returns the result. This ensures that the last substring of `s` in lexicographical order is returned. 

Please note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because it uses the `groupby` function to group consecutive identical characters, and then iterates over the groups to find the longest group and append the remaining characters. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of the groups and the result. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Check Sum Condition**: First, it checks if the sum of the `colsum` array equals the sum of the `upper` and `lower` values. If not, it returns an empty matrix because it's impossible to construct a valid matrix under the given constraints.

2. **Initialize Matrix**: It initializes a 2D matrix with zeros, where each row has the same length as the `colsum` array.

3. **Iterate Through Colsum**: It iterates through each element in the `colsum` array:
   - If the element is `2`, it sets both corresponding elements in the matrix to `1` and decrements both `upper` and `lower`.
   - If the element is `1`, it checks if `upper` is greater than `0`. If so, it sets the corresponding element in the first row to `1` and decrements `upper`. Otherwise, it sets the corresponding element in the second row to `1` and decrements `lower`.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all elements, it checks if both `upper` and `lower` are zero. If not, it returns an empty matrix because it's impossible to fill the remaining elements.

5. **Return Matrix**: If the matrix is valid, it returns the constructed matrix. Otherwise, it returns an empty matrix. 

This approach ensures that the matrix

This solution uses a Trie to store all possible prefixes of the words. The `is_valid_prefix` function checks if a given prefix exists in the Trie. The `backtrack` function recursively builds word squares by adding valid words to the current path. If the path reaches the length of a word, it is added to the result. Finally, the solution returns all valid word squares.

```


This solution works as follows:

1. Sort the array `nums` in ascending order.
2. Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find the minimum and maximum values in the array, respectively.
3. Use a set `averages` to store the distinct averages of the two values.
4. Loop until the two pointers meet:
   - Calculate the average of the two values at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - Add the average to the set `averages`.
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left.
5. Return the number of distinct averages stored in the set `averages`. This is done by returning the length of the set. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the set used to store the distinct averages. The constraints guarantee that the input array is even and contains non-negative integers, so these assumptions are valid. The solution handles the case where there is a tie for the minimum or maximum value by using any of the two values. However, since the problem guarantees that there will be at least one distinct average, this assumption does not affect the correctness of the solution. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

```

This implementation uses Python's built-in `random.shuffle` function to generate a random permutation of the array. The `reset` method simply returns the original array, and the `shuffle` method returns a new shuffled array. This ensures that all permutations of the array are equally likely as a result of the shuffling. 

Note that this implementation does not modify the original array, but instead creates a new shuffled array. If you need to shuffle the original array in place, you can modify the `shuffle` method to use a different approach, such as swapping elements in place. However, this would require additional logic to ensure that all permutations are equally likely, which is not the case with the current implementation. 

Also, keep in mind that the `reset` method returns a copy of the original array, not a reference to it. This means that changes to the original array after resetting will not affect the returned array from the `reset` method. If you need to modify the original array, you can pass a reference to it to the `Solution` constructor and use it in the `shuffle` method. However, this would require additional logic to ensure that all permutations are equally likely, which is not the case with the current implementation. 

Finally, note that the `shuffle` method returns a new shuffled array, not a reference to it. This means that changes to the returned array will not affect the original array. If you need to modify the original array, you can pass a reference to it to the `Solution` constructor and use it in the `shuffle` method.

```
Here is the explanation of the solution:
1. First, we initialize the `count` array to keep track of the number of times each index is requested. We iterate through the `requests` array and increment the count for the start index and decrement the count for the end index plus one.
2. Next, we calculate the prefix sum of the `count` array. This allows us to quickly determine the number of times each index is requested in a given range.
3. We then sort the `count` array in descending order and the `nums` array in descending order. This ensures that we are using the largest values for the range queries.
4. Finally, we iterate through the `nums` array and calculate the maximum sum of the range queries by multiplying the value at each index with the corresponding count and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
5. We return the result as the maximum sum of the range queries. Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the additional arrays used. However, this approach is efficient for the given constraints. ```python

        return min_distance if min_distance != float('inf') else -1
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. Calculate the length of the `words` list.
2. Initialize `min_distance` to infinity to keep track of the shortest distance found.
3. Iterate through both directions from the `startIndex` to ensure we check all possible positions around the circular array.
4. For each position, check if the word matches the `target`. If it does, calculate the absolute distance from the `startIndex`.
5. Update `min_distance` if the current distance is smaller.
6. After checking all positions, return `min_distance` if it is not infinity, otherwise return -1 indicating the `target` is not found.

This solution works as follows:

1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

2. We initialize a set `seen_frequencies` to keep track of the frequencies we have encountered so far.

3. We initialize a variable `deletions` to keep track of the number of characters we need to delete.

4. We iterate over the frequency of each character in the string. For each frequency:
   - If the frequency is already in the `seen_frequencies` set, we need to remove one character to make the frequency unique. We decrement the frequency and increment the `deletions` counter.
   - If the frequency is greater than zero, we add the new frequency to the `seen_frequencies` set.

5. Finally, we return the `deletions` counter, which represents the minimum number of characters we need to delete to make the string good.

            dfs(node.right, path)
        dfs(root, 0)
        return self.res
```

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. The `dfs` function takes two arguments: the current node and the current path, represented as a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a digit from 1 to 9, and 1 indicates that the digit has been encountered in the current path.

1. If the current node is `None`, the function returns immediately.
2. The function updates the current path by XORing the current node's value with the bitmask. This operation effectively toggles the presence of the current node's value in the path.
3. If the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right children), the function checks if the current path is a pseudo-palindromic path. A path is pseudo-palindromic if exactly one digit has an odd count in the path. This condition is checked using the expression `path & (path - 1) == 0`.
4. If the current path is a pseudo-palindromic path, the function increments the result counter `self.res`.
5. The function recursively calls itself for the left and right children of the current node, passing the updated path.
6. Finally, the function returns the result counter `self.res`.

This solution efficiently counts the number of pseudo-palindromic paths in the binary tree using a bitmask to represent the path and a DFS traversal to explore all possible paths. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursion stack.

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        # Flatten the matrix into a single list and perform binary search
        flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
        left, right = 0, len(flattened) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            mid_value = flattened[mid]
            
            if mid_value == target:
                return True

            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return False
```

This solution flattens the matrix into a single list and performs a binary search on this list. The time complexity is O(log(m * n)), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. The space complexity is O(m * n) due to the flattened list. However, since the problem constraints allow for a time complexity of O(log(m * n)), this approach is efficient enough. 

The binary search works by comparing the middle element of the current sublist with the target value. If they are equal, the function returns `True`. If the middle element is less than the target, the search continues in the right half of the sublist. If the middle element is greater than the target, the search continues in the left half of the sublist. This process repeats until the target is found or the sublist is empty. If the target is not found, the function returns `False`.

        def backtrack(start, path):

        result = []
        backtrack(0, [])
        return result
```

This solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of the candidates that sum up to the target. The `backtrack` function is a recursive function that takes the current index `start` and the current path of selected candidates. If the sum of the current path equals the target, it appends a copy of the path to the result list. If the sum exceeds the target, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it iterates over the remaining candidates, adding each to the path, and recursively calling `backtrack` with the next index. After the recursive call, it removes the last candidate from the path to explore other possibilities. The initial call to `backtrack` starts with an index of 0 and an empty path. The result list is returned after exploring all possibilities. This ensures that all unique combinations are found without repetition. Let me know if you have any questions!

    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort intervals by start time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        # Iterate through each interval

        # The size of the heap represents the number of rooms needed
        return len(heap)
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort Intervals**: The intervals are sorted by their start times. This ensures that we process meetings in chronological order.

2. **Use Min-Heap**: A min-heap is used to keep track of the end times of meetings. The heap helps efficiently find the earliest meeting that has ended.

3. **Iterate Through Intervals**: For each interval, we check if the heap is not empty. If it is not empty, it means there is a meeting that has ended before the current meeting starts. We pop this meeting's end time from the heap.

4. **Push Current Meeting's End Time**: We push the current meeting's end time onto the heap. This represents the latest time when the current meeting can be completed.

5. **Result**: The size of the heap at the end of the iteration represents the number of rooms required to schedule all meetings without overlap. This is because each room must have at least one meeting ongoing at any time. 

This approach ensures that we always have the minimum number of rooms needed by processing meetings in the correct order and using the heap to manage the end times of ongoing meetings. 

**Complexity Analysis**:
- Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. Sorting the intervals takes O(n log n) time, and each insertion and deletion in the heap takes O(log n) time.
- Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of intervals. The space is used for the heap

        return result
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. We first calculate the prefix sums of the matrix. The prefix sum at position `(i, j)` is the sum of all elements in the submatrix from `(1, 1)` to `(i, j)`.

2. We then initialize the result matrix with zeros.

3. For each cell `(i, j)` in the result matrix, we determine the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the submatrix that we need to sum. These coordinates are calculated using the values of `k`.

4. Using the prefix sums, we compute the sum of the submatrix using the formula:
   ```
   result[i][j] = prefix_sum[bottom_right][right_bottom] - prefix_sum[top_left][right_bottom] - prefix_sum[bottom_right][left_top] + prefix_sum[top_left][left_top]
   ```

**Code solution:** 

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistToClosest(self, seats: List[int]) -> int:
        max_dist = 0
        left = -1
        
        for i, seat in enumerate(seats):
            if seat == 1:
                if left == -1:
                    # If no previous person, max distance is to the left boundary
                    max_dist = i
                else:
                    # Calculate the maximum distance to the closest person
                    max_dist = max(max_dist, (i - left) // 2)
                left = i
        
        # Check the distance to the right boundary
        if seats[-1] == 0:
            max_dist = max(max_dist, len(seats) - 1 - left)
        
        return max_dist
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `max_dist` to 0 and `left` to -1. `max_dist` will store the maximum distance to the closest person, and `left` will store the index of the last person seen.

2. Iterate through the `seats` list using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the value `seat`.

3. If the current seat is occupied (`seat == 1`):
   - If `left` is -1, it means this is the first person seen, so the maximum distance is to the left boundary, which is `i`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the maximum distance to the closest person by taking the average of the current index `i` and the previous person's index `left`. This ensures that the distance is maximized between two people.
   - Update `left` to the current index `i`.

4. After the loop, check the distance to the right boundary. If the last seat is empty (`seats[-1] == 0`), update `max_dist` to the maximum of the current `max_dist` and the distance from the last person to the right boundary.

5. Return the `max_dist` as the result. This gives the maximum distance to the closest person for any seat in the given list. 

This approach ensures that we find the optimal seat for Alex by considering both the left and right boundaries and the distance between consecutive occupied seats.

            lastPerson = i

    This solution uses a binary search approach to find the minimum possible value of `x` that satisfies the condition of distributing all products to the retail stores such that the maximum number of products given to any store is minimized. The `is_valid` function checks if it's possible to distribute the products with a maximum of `x` products per store. The binary search iterates over the possible values of `x` from 1 to the maximum quantity in the `quantities` array, and returns the smallest valid value of `x`.

This solution works by first sorting the courses by their last day. Then, it uses a min-heap to keep track of the durations of the courses that are currently being taken. For each course, it adds its duration to the total and pushes it onto the heap. If the total duration exceeds the last day, it pops the course with the longest duration from the heap and subtracts its duration from the total. Finally, it returns the length of the heap, which represents the maximum number of courses that can be taken.

This solution works as follows:

1. **Graph Construction**: We first build an adjacency list representation of the graph using the `richer` array. Each person points to all the people who are richer than them.

2. **Result Initialization**: We initialize a result array `result` of size `n` with `-1`. This array will store the least quiet person for each person.

3. **DFS Function**: We define a recursive DFS function `dfs(node)` that calculates the least quiet person in the subtree rooted at `node`. If the result for `node` is already computed, we return it directly.

4. **Finding the Quietest Person**: For each node, we iterate through its neighbors and recursively find the quietest person in the subtrees. We update `min_quiet` if a quieter person is found.

5. **Storing the Result**: After determining the quietest person in the subtree, we store this result in the `result` array for the current node.

6. **Performing DFS**: Finally, we perform DFS for each node in the graph to compute the least quiet person for each person.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the least quiet person for each person in the group, leveraging the properties of the graph and the DFS traversal. The time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of people and m is the number of richer relationships, making it suitable for the given

            res[i] += res[i - 1]
        return res
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize a result array `res` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. This array will store the cumulative number of seats reserved for each flight.

2. We iterate through each booking in the `bookings` list. For each booking `[start, end, seats]`:
   - We increment the value at index `start - 1` in the `res` array by `seats`. This represents the fact that `seats` more people are boarding the flight from `start` to `end`.
   - If `end` is less than `n`, we decrement the value at index `end` in the `res` array by `seats`. This represents the fact that `seats` more people are leaving the flight from `start` to `end`.

3. After processing all bookings, the `res` array contains the cumulative number of seats reserved for each flight.

4. Finally, we iterate through the `res` array and update each element by adding the previous element's value. This gives us the final number of seats reserved for each flight.

5. We return the `res` array as the result. ```python
```python
class Solution:
    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * n

            res[start - 1] += seats
            if end < n:
                res[end] -= seats

This solution works by first sorting the list of numbers. Then, it calculates the maximum product of the three largest numbers and the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number. The maximum of these two products is returned as the result. This approach ensures that we consider both the possibility of having the largest three numbers or the two smallest numbers and the largest number together. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space. However, note that the constraints specify that the length of the input list is at most 10^4, which is manageable for sorting. If the list were much larger, a more efficient approach might be needed.

        ans = (ans * 2) % mod
        
        return ans
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort the Ranges**: We first sort the ranges based on their start points. This helps in easily identifying overlapping ranges.

2. **Initialize Variables**: We initialize variables to keep track of the current range (`start` and `end`), the answer (`ans`), and the modulo value (`mod`).

3. **Iterate Through Ranges**: We iterate through the sorted ranges. For each range:
   - If the current range overlaps with the previous range (`ranges[i][0] <= end`), we update the `end` point to be the maximum of the current range's end and the previous range's end.
   - If there is no overlap, we increment the answer by 2 (since we can either put the current range in the same group as the previous range or in a new group) and reset the `start` and `end` to the current range's values.

4. **Final Adjustment**: After iterating through all ranges, we increment the answer by 2 for the last range to account for the possibility of putting it in a new group.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle overlapping ranges and count the number of ways to split

        # Sort events by start day
        events.sort()
        
        return dfs(0, k)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization (`@lru_cache`) to solve the problem efficiently. The `dfs` function recursively explores two choices for each event: skipping it or attending it if it doesn't overlap with the next event. The `bisect_right` function is used to find the index of the first event that starts after the current event's end day. The solution ensures that the maximum sum of values is achieved within the given constraints. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting and the space complexity is O(nk) for the memoization cache. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sorting Events**: The events are sorted by their start day. This allows us to easily skip overlapping events.

2. **Recursive Function**: The `dfs` function takes two parameters: the current event index `i` and the number of events that can still be attended `k`.

3. **Base Cases**: If the current event index exceeds the number of events or `k` is zero, return 0. This handles the case where there are no more events or the limit of events to attend has been reached.

4. **Skipping the Current Event**: Calculate the maximum value by skipping the current event and moving to the next event.

5. **Attending the Current Event**: Calculate the maximum value by attending the current event if it doesn't overlap with the next event. Use binary search to find the first event that starts after the current event's end day.

6. **Memoization**: Store the results of

                    break

        return result
``` 
This solution works as follows:

1. **Convert Words to Bitmask Representations**: 
   - For each word in `startWords`, convert it to its bitmask representation using the `count_bits` function. This function counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the word, which serves as the bitmask.

2. **Store Bitmask-Word Pairs**:
   - Use a dictionary `start_bitmask` to store the bitmask as the key and the original word as the value. This allows for efficient lookup when checking if a target word can be formed.

3. **Count Target Words**:
   - Initialize a counter `result` to zero.
   - Iterate over each word in `targetWords`.
   - For each word, try to remove each bit (from '0' to '25') to generate a new bitmask.
   - Check if the generated bitmask exists in the `start_bitmask` dictionary.
   - If it does, increment the `result` counter and break out of the inner loop, as we found a matching word in `startWords`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After checking all target words, return the `result`, which represents the number of target words that can be formed by appending and rearranging letters from `startWords`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check each target word against the `startWords` by leveraging bitmasks, making it suitable for large inputs. 

**Explanation of the Code**:

- **`count_bits` Function**: This helper function counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of a word, which is used to create a bitmask.

- **Bitmask-Word Mapping**: The `

            anagrams[sorted_s].append(s)
        
        return list(anagrams.values())
```

This solution uses a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to group the anagrams. For each string in the input list, it sorts the characters and uses the sorted string as a key in the dictionary. The strings with the same sorted key are grouped together. Finally, it returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains anagrams of each other. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m log m), where n is the number of strings and m is the average length of the strings. The space complexity is O(n * m) due to the storage of the sorted strings and the dictionary. 

To understand how this works, let's consider an example:

Suppose the input list is `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`.

- The string "eat" is sorted to "aet", and it is added to the dictionary with the key "aet".
- The string "tea" is sorted to "aet", and it is added to the dictionary with the key "aet". Since the key already exists, the string is appended to the list associated with the key.
- The string "tan" is sorted to "ant", and it is added to the dictionary with the key "ant".
- The string "ate" is sorted to "aet", and it is added to the dictionary with the key "aet". Since the key already exists, the string is appended to the list associated with the key.
- The string "nat" is sorted to "ant", and it is added to the dictionary with the key "ant". Since the key already exists, the string is appended to the list associated with the key.
- The string "bat" is sorted to "abt", and it is added to the dictionary with the key "abt".

After processing all the strings, the dictionary will look like this:

- "aet": 73%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž  | 22/30 [04:25<01:36, 12.04s/it]

        return total_dist - min_diff
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Calculate the total distance required for the squirrel to collect all nuts and put them under the tree. This is done by summing the distances from the tree to each nut and then doubling it because the squirrel has to go back and forth for each nut.

2. Initialize a variable `min_diff` to store the minimum difference between the distance from the squirrel to a nut and the average distance calculated in step 1.

3. Iterate through each nut and calculate the difference between the distance from the squirrel to the nut and the average distance. Update `min_diff` if the current difference is smaller.

4. Finally, return the total distance minus `min_diff`. This gives the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. ``` ``` ```python

            if digit > 1:
                return False
        
        return True
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Convert the integer `n` to a list of its digits in base 3 using a loop.
2. Check if any digit in the list is greater than 1.
3. If any digit is greater than 1, return `False` because it means `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three.
4. If all digits are less than or equal to 1, return `True`.

This approach ensures that `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three. Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```python
# Test cases
print(Solution().checkPowersOfThree(12))  # Output: True
print(Solution().checkPowersOfThree(91))  # Output: True
print(Solution().checkPowersOfThree(21))  # Output: False
```

These test cases should pass, confirming that the solution works correctly. Let me know if you have any further questions!

            n = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(n))
            
        return n == 1
```


This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize an empty set called `seen` to keep track of numbers that have already been encountered during the process.

2. We enter a while loop that continues as long as `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` has not been seen before.

3. Inside the loop, we add `n` to the `seen` set to prevent infinite loops.

4. We calculate the next value of `n` by summing the squares of its digits. This is done using a generator expression within the `sum` function.

5. After updating `n`, we check if it has reached 1. If it has, we return `True`.

6. If `n` is not 1 and has not been seen before, we continue the loop.

7. If the loop exits without `n` reaching 1, we return `False`. This indicates that `n` is not a happy number. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if a number is happy by leveraging a set to track previously seen numbers and a loop to repeatedly calculate the next value of `n`. The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), where n is the input number, and the space complexity is O(log n) due to the storage of numbers in the `seen` set. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

**Solution Explanation:**

        # Initialize the number of buildings and the number of requests
        num_buildings = n

        # Create a list to keep track of the net change in employees for each building
        net_change = [0] * num_buildings
        
        # Function to perform a backtracking search to find the maximum number of achievable requests
        def backtrack(index, current_requests):
            nonlocal max_requests
            
            # If all requests have been processed, update the maximum number of requests if needed
            if index == num_requests:
                if all(change == 0 for change in net_change):
                    max_requests = max(max_requests, current_requests)
                return
            
            # Process the current request
            net_change[requests[index][0]] -= 1
            net_change[requests[index][1]] += 1
            
            # Recursively process the next request
            backtrack(index + 1, current_requests + 1)
            
            # Backtrack: undo the changes made to the net change
            net_change[requests[index][0]] += 1
            net_change[requests[index][1]] -= 1
            
            # Recursively process the next request without the current request
            backtrack(index + 1, current_requests)
        
        # Initialize the maximum number of requests to 0
        max_requests = 0
        
        # Start the backtracking search from the first request
        backtrack(0, 0)
        
        # Return the maximum number of achievable requests
        return max_requests
```

This solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of requests. It keeps track of the net change in employees for each building and ensures that the total net change is zero for all buildings. The function `backtrack` recursively processes each request, updating the net change and checking if the current combination of requests is valid. The solution keeps track of the maximum number of achievable requests found during the search. The time complexity of this solution is exponential due to the number of possible combinations of requests, but it is feasible for the given constraints. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

This solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible ways to map characters in the pattern to substrings in the string `s`. The `backtrack` function takes two parameters: `i` and `j`, which represent the current positions in the pattern and `s`, respectively. The function returns `True` if a valid mapping is found, otherwise `False`.

Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

1. **Base Case**: If both pointers (`i` and `j`) reach the end of their respective strings, return `True`. This means we have successfully matched all characters in the pattern with substrings in `s`.

2. **Edge Case**: If either pointer reaches the end of their respective strings, return `False`. This means there are unmatched characters in either the pattern or `s`.

3. **Backtracking**: Try all possible matches for the current character in the pattern. Iterate through the string `s` starting from index `j` and try to match the substring `s

            if char_map.get(c) != word or word_map.get(word) != c:

class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
```
**Solution Explanation:** 
```python
class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
        patches = 0
        i = 0
        curr_sum = 0

        while curr_sum < n:
            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= curr_sum + 1:
                curr_sum += nums[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                curr_sum += curr_sum + 1
                patches += 1

        return patches
```
This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `patches` to count the number of patches needed, `i` to iterate through the `nums` array, and `curr_sum` to keep track of the current sum of numbers that can be formed.

2. Use a while loop to continue adding numbers to `curr_sum` until it reaches or exceeds `n`.

3. Inside the loop, check if the current number in `nums` is less than or equal to `curr_sum + 1`. If so, add it to `curr_sum` and move to the next number in `nums`.

4. If the current number in `nums` is greater than `curr_sum + 1`, it means we need to add a patch to cover the gap between `curr_sum` and `curr_sum + 1`. Add `curr_sum + 1` to `curr_sum` and increment the `patches` counter.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 until `curr_sum` reaches or exceeds `n`.

6. Return the total number of patches needed. ```python
```python
class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
        patches = 0
        i = 0
        curr_sum = 0

        while curr_sum < n:
            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= curr_sum + 1:
                curr_sum += nums[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                curr_sum += curr_sum + 1
                patches += 1

        return patches
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `patches` to count the number of patches needed, `i` to iterate through the `nums` array, and `curr_sum` to keep track of the current sum of numbers
ref:
def minPatches(nums, n):
    max_sum = 0
    patches = 0
    i = 0

    while max_sum < n:
        if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= max_sum + 1:
            max_sum += nums[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            max_sum += max_sum + 1
            patches += 1

    return patches

        # Convert both dividend and divisor to positive for easier computation

        while dividend >= divisor:
            temp = divisor
            multiple = 1

            # Double the divisor and multiple until it exceeds the dividend
            while dividend >= (temp << 1):
                temp <<= 1
                multiple <<= 1

            # Subtract the doubled divisor from the dividend and add the corresponding multiple to the result
            dividend -= temp
            result += multiple

        return max(min(result, 2147483647), -2147483648)
``` 

This solution uses bitwise operations to perform division without using multiplication, division, or modulo operators. It handles edge cases such as when the divisor is zero or when the dividend is the smallest negative number. The result is adjusted for the sign of the input values and ensures it fits within the 32-bit signed integer range. 

The algorithm works by repeatedly doubling the divisor and checking if it can be subtracted from the dividend. If it can, it adds the corresponding multiple to the result and continues. This process is repeated until the dividend is less than the divisor. Finally, the sign of the result is applied and the result is adjusted to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range
ref:
def divide(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:
    if dividend == -(2**31) and divisor == -1:
        return 2**31 - 1

    dvd = abs(dividend)
    dvs = abs(divisor)
    ans = 0

    while dvd >= dvs:

            temp <<= 1

                return True

```


This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible splits of the string. The `dfs` function takes two parameters: `start`, which is the current index in the string, and `prev`, which is the value of the previous substring. The function returns `True` if a valid split is found, and `False` otherwise.

The outer loop iterates over all possible starting indices for the first substring. For each starting index, the inner loop tries to find the end index of the first substring by iterating over all possible end indices. It then converts the substring to an integer and checks if it is equal to `prev - 1`. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with the end index and the value of the current substring. If a valid split is found, the function returns `True`.

If no valid split is found after trying all possible splits, the function returns `False`. Note that the solution assumes that the input string is non-empty and consists only of digits. ``` ``` ```python
from typing import List

    def splitString(self, s: str) -> bool:

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a 3D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of distinct sequences of length `i` ending with `j` and having `k` as the previous roll. We use a modulus of \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

2. **Base Case**: For single rolls (`i = 1`), we set `dp[1][j][0] = 1` for each `j` from 1 to 6, representing the initial sequence starting with each number.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate over each length `i` from 2 to `n`. For each length `i`, we iterate over each possible ending number `j` and each possible previous roll `k`. We check if `gcd(j, k) == 1` (i.e., `j` and `k` are coprime) and `abs(i - j) > 2` (i.e.,

**Code solution:** 

```python
class Solution:
    def bestClosingTime(self, customers: str) -> int:
        n = len(customers)
        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Calculate prefix sum of 'Y' characters
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + (1 if customers[i] == 'Y' else 0)
        
        min_penalty = float('inf')
        best_hour = -1
        
        # Calculate penalty for each closing time
        for i in range(n + 1):
            penalty = prefix_sum[i] + (n - i - prefix_sum[i])

                best_hour = i
        
        return best_hour
```


This solution works as follows:

1. We first calculate the prefix sum of the number of 'Y' characters up to each hour. This helps us quickly determine the number of 'Y' characters in any subarray.

2. We initialize `min_penalty` to infinity and `best_hour` to -1. These will help us track the minimum penalty and the corresponding closing time.

3. We iterate through each possible closing time from 0 to n (inclusive). For each closing time, we calculate the penalty as the sum of the number of 'Y' characters before the closing time and the number of 'N' characters after the closing time.

4. If the current penalty is less than the minimum penalty found so far, we update `min_penalty` and `best_hour`.

5. Finally, we return the `best_hour`, which is the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur the minimum penalty. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the penalty for each closing time and find the optimal one in linear time. 

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***

    def leftMostColumnWithOne(self, binaryMatrix: 'BinaryMatrix') -> int:
```
**Solution Explanation:** 
```python
class Solution:
    def leftMostColumnWithOne(self, binaryMatrix: 'BinaryMatrix') -> int:
        rows, cols = binaryMatrix.dimensions()
        leftmost_col = cols  # Initialize with the maximum possible column index
        
        for row in range(rows):
            # Start from the rightmost column and move left
            col = cols - 1
            while col >= 0:
                if binaryMatrix.get(row, col) == 1:
                    leftmost_col = min(leftmost_col, col)
                    break  # Move to the next row if a 1 is found
                col -= 1
        
        # If leftmost_col is still cols, it means no 1 was found
        return leftmost_col if leftmost_col != cols else -1
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Get the dimensions of the binary matrix.
2. Initialize `leftmost_col` to `cols`, which is the maximum possible column index.
3. Iterate through each row of the matrix.
4. For each row, start from the rightmost column and move left.
5. If a 1 is found, update `leftmost_col` to the current column index and break out of the inner loop to move to the next row.
6. After iterating through all rows, if `leftmost_col` is still `cols`, it means no 1 was found, so return `-1`. Otherwise, return `leftmost_col`.

This approach ensures that we find the leftmost column with a 1 in O(rows * cols) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints. Let me know if you have any questions!

This solution uses two heaps, `buy_orders` and `sell_orders`, to keep track of buy and sell orders respectively. The `buy_orders` heap is sorted by the negative price (to simulate a max-heap), and the `sell_orders` heap is sorted by price. 

For each buy order, the algorithm attempts to match it with the smallest available sell order (i.e., the order with the lowest price). If a match is found, the amount of the buy order is reduced by the amount of the sell order, and the remaining amount is pushed back onto the `buy_orders` heap. If no match is found, the buy order is pushed back onto the `buy_orders` heap.

Similarly, for each sell order, the algorithm attempts to match it with the largest available buy order (i.e., the order with the highest price). If a match is found

This solution works as follows:

1. Split the input sentence into individual words using the `split()` method.
2. Iterate over each word in the list of words.
3. Use the `startswith()` method to check if the current word starts with the `searchWord`.
4. If a match is found, return the 1-based index of the word using `i + 1`.
5. If no match is found after checking all words, return `-1`. 
This approach ensures that we efficiently check each word in the sentence and return the correct index or `-1` if no matching prefix is found. The use of `startswith()` makes the code concise and easy to understand.

**Explanation**:

1. **Base Case**: If the linked list is empty or has only one node, return it as is.

2. **Find the Middle**: Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list. This helps in splitting the list into two halves.

3. **Reverse the Second Half**: Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the middle node. This is done by iterating through the second half and reversing the pointers.

4. **Merge the Two Halves**: Merge the two halves by comparing the values of the nodes from both halves. Attach the smaller node to the merged list and move the corresponding pointer forward.

5. **Append Remaining Nodes**: After merging, append any remaining nodes from the unreversed half to the merged list.

This approach ensures that the linked list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the actual values of its nodes, maintaining a time complexity of O(n). **Follow-up**: If you need to solve this problem in O(n) time complexity, consider using a variation of the merge sort algorithm tailored for linked lists. However, the provided solution using the slow and fast pointer technique is efficient and straightforward for this problem.

This solution works as follows:

1. **Transpose the Matrix**: We iterate over the upper triangle of the matrix (including the diagonal) and swap each element with its corresponding element across the diagonal. This effectively transposes the matrix.

2. **Reverse Each Row**: After transposing, we reverse each row of the matrix. This completes the 90-degree clockwise rotation.

This approach modifies the matrix in place without using additional space, meeting the problem's constraints. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

This solution works as follows:

1. **Find the Middle**: We use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**: Once we have the middle, we reverse the second half of the list. We maintain a previous pointer and a current pointer. We iterate through the second half, reversing the direction of each node's pointer.

3. **Merge the Two Halves**: We now have two separate lists: the first half from the start to the middle, and the reversed second half. We merge these two lists by alternating nodes from each list. We update the pointers accordingly to link the nodes together.

This approach ensures that the list is reordered in the desired manner without modifying the values of the nodes. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the list in place.

        return dp[0][n - 1]
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`. The base case is when the length of the substring is 1, in which case the longest palindromic subsequence is the character itself. For substrings of length greater than 1, it checks if the characters at the start and end of the substring are the same. If they are, it adds 2 to the result of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring excluding the start and end characters. If they are not the same, it takes the maximum of the longest palindromic subsequences in the substrings excluding the start or end character. Finally, the function returns the value of `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string `s`.

        n = len(s)
        ans = 0

            ans = (ans + count_greater * (n - i)) % MOD

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize a variable `MOD` to handle large numbers by taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
2. We iterate over each character in the string `s`.
3. For each character `s[i]`, we count the number of characters greater than `s[i]` to its right using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
4. We add the product of `count_greater` and `(n - i)` to the result `ans`. This represents the number of operations needed to make `s[i]` the smallest character in the prefix.
5. Finally, we return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). **Leetcode Example Question 3***

                min_cost = min(min_cost, ratio * total_quality)
        
        return min_cost
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Calculate Wage-to-Quality Ratios**: We create a list of tuples `(wage / quality, quality)` for each worker, where `wage` is the minimum wage expectation and `quality` is the worker's quality.

2. **Sort Workers**: We sort the workers based on their wage-to-quality ratios. This ensures that we always consider the most cost-effective workers first.

3. **Use a Priority Queue**: We use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the largest `k` qualities. The negative sign is used because Python's `heapq` module implements a min-heap, but we need a max-heap.

4. **Iterate Through Workers**: For each worker, we add their quality to the priority queue and update the total quality. If the size of the priority queue exceeds `k`, we remove the largest quality.

5. **Calculate Cost**: Once we have exactly `k` qualities, we calculate the cost as the product of the wage-to-quality ratio and the total quality. We keep track of the minimum cost encountered.

6. **Return Result

This solution works as follows:

1. **Identify Buildings**: We first identify all the building locations in the grid and store them in a list called `buildings`.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For each building location, we perform a BFS to calculate the shortest distance to all empty lands. This is done using a queue and a visited set to keep track of the nodes we have already processed.

3. **Calculate Total Distance**: After calculating the shortest distance to all empty lands for a particular building, we calculate the total distance by summing up the distances to all empty lands.

4. **Find Minimum Distance**: We keep track of the minimum total distance

This solution uses backtracking to explore all possible configurations of the N-Queens puzzle. It checks if placing a queen in a given position is valid by ensuring that no other queen is in the same column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal. The `is_valid` function helps determine if a queen can be placed at a specific position. The `backtrack` function recursively places queens and backtracks when a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted. The `solutions` list stores all valid configurations of the board. Finally, the method returns the list of solutions. 

If you have any further questions or need additional explanations, feel free to ask! 

### Explanation:

- **Backtracking**: We use a recursive approach to try placing queens in each row and then move to the next row. If a valid placement is found, we proceed; otherwise, we backtrack to try different placements.

- **Validation**: Before placing a queen, we check if it is valid by ensuring that no other queen is in the same column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal

class Solution:
    def countRectangles(self, rectangles: List[List[int]], points: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
``` To solve this problem, we can use a combination of sorting and binary search. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Sort the Rectangles**: First, sort the rectangles based on their width (`li`). This helps in efficiently finding the number of rectangles that contain a given point.

2. **Binary Search for Each Point**: For each point, use binary search to find the number of rectangles that have a width greater than or equal to the x-coordinate of the point. This ensures that the rectangle contains the point.

3. **Count the Rectangles**: For each rectangle that contains the point, increment the count.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countRectangles(self, rectangles: List[List[int]], points: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Sort rectangles based on width (li)
        rectangles.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Preprocess the rectangles to store their heights in a dictionary
        height_dict = {}
        for rect in rectangles:
            if rect[0] not in height_dict:
                height_dict[rect[0]] = []
            height_dict[rect[0]].append(rect[1])
        
        # Sort the points
        points.sort()
        
        # Function to perform binary search on heights
        def binary_search(heights, target):
            left, right = 0, len(heights) - 1
            while left <= right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if heights[mid] >= target:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
            return len(heights) - left
        
        # Calculate the number of rectangles containing each point
        result = []
        for x, y in points:
            if x in height_dict:
                count = binary_search(height_dict[x], y)
                result.append(count)
            else:
                result.append(0)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

- **Sorting Rectangles**: We sort the rectangles by their width (`li`) to facilitate efficient binary search later.

- **Preprocessing Heights**: We store the heights of rectangles for each width in a dictionary. This allows us to quickly access the heights for a given width.

- **Binary Search**: For each point, we use binary search to find

            return prob / 8.0
        
        return dp(r, c, K)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization (`@lru_cache`) to efficiently compute the probability that the knight remains on the board after making exactly `K` moves. The `dp` function calculates the probability for a given position `(x, y)` with `k` moves remaining. It considers all possible moves of the knight and recursively calculates the probability for each move. The result is divided by 8.0 because there are 8 possible moves for a knight. The base case for the recursion is when `k` is 0, where the knight is already on the board, and the probability is 1.0. The solution handles edge cases such as when `K` is 0 by directly returning 1.0. **The time complexity is O(N^2 * K) due to the memoization and the recursive calls, and the space complexity is O(N^2 * K) for the memoization table.** Here is the code for the solution:

    def knightProbability(self, N: int, K: int, r: int, c: int) -> float:

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We initialize a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree.
   - A list `values` is created to store the values of nodes at each level. The size of this list is based on the maximum number of nodes in the tree, which is 214 in this case.

2. **Level-Order Traversal**:
   - We perform a level-order traversal of the tree using the queue.
   - For each level, we collect the values of nodes in a list and store them in the `values` list at the corresponding index.

3. **DFS to Reverse Values**:
   - We define a recursive function `dfs` to traverse the tree and reverse the values at odd levels.
   - If the current level is odd, we pop the last value from the `values` list for that level and assign it to the current node's value.
   - We recursively call `dfs` for the left and right children of the current node.

4. **Return the Root**:
   - After traversing the entire tree, we return the root of the tree.

This approach ensures that the values at each odd level are reversed while maintaining the structure of the tree. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of node values in the `values` list. The use of a queue allows us to efficiently perform a level-order traversal, and the recursive DFS function helps in reversing the values at odd levels. 

This solution works well for the given constraints and

        self.current_snap_id = 0

        if i == 0:
            return 0
        return self.snapshots[index][i - 1][1]
```


This solution works as follows:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `self.snapshots` to store snapshots for each index.
   - Initialize `self.current_snap_id` to 0, which will keep track of the current snapshot ID.

2. **Setting a Value (`set` method)**:
   - If the index is not already present in `self.snapshots`, create a new list for that index.
   - Append a tuple `(current_snap_id, val)` to the list, where `current_snap_id` is the current snapshot ID and `val` is the value to be set.

3. **Taking a Snapshot (`snap` method)**:
   - Increment `self.current_snap_id` by 1 and return the previous snapshot ID (which is `self.current_snap_id - 1`).

4. **Getting a Value (`get` method)**:
   - If the index is not present in `self.snapshots`, return 0.
   - Use `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `(snap_id + 1, float('inf'))` in the list of snapshots for the given index.
   - If the insertion point is 0, it means all snapshots are older than the given `snap_id`, so return 0.
   - Otherwise, return the value from the snapshot at the previous index (i.e., `self.snapshots[index][i - 1][1]`).

This approach ensures efficient handling of setting and getting values, even when dealing with multiple snapshots and

This solution works as follows:

1. **Create Adjacency List**: We first create an adjacency list to represent the graph using the given edges.

2. **Initialize Variables**: We initialize `max_score` to `-1` to keep track of the maximum score found.

3. **Check Each Edge**: For each edge `(u, v)`, we consider it as a potential starting point for the node sequence.

4. **Get Neighbors**: We get the neighbors of `u` and `v` and sort them based on their scores in descending order.

5. **Try Combinations**: We try all combinations of three neighbors from `u` and `v` to form a valid node

3. **Main Logic**: The main logic of the solution involves generating k-mirror numbers of increasing lengths until the desired number of k-mirror numbers (`n

``` 

This solution defines a helper function `count_divisors` that checks if a number has exactly four divisors. It then iterates over the input list `nums`, calculates the sum of divisors for each number using `count_divisors`, and returns the total sum. If a number does not have exactly four divisors, it is ignored in the sum. 

The solution efficiently counts the divisors of each number and handles the constraints provided. Here's a brief explanation of the approach:

1. Define a helper function `count_divisors` that takes an integer `num` and returns the number of divisors if it has exactly four divisors, otherwise returns 0.

2. Initialize a variable `total_sum` to accumulate the sum of divisors.

3. Iterate over each number in the input list `nums`.

4. For each number, call the `count_divisors` function and add the result to `total_sum`.

5. Return the `total_sum` after processing all numbers in the list. 

This approach ensures that we correctly count the divisors for each number and handle the constraints effectively. Let me know if you need further clarification or modifications!

This solution works as follows:

1. Define a helper function `get_lca(a, b)` to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes `a` and `b` in a complete binary tree.
2. For each query `(a, b)`:
   - Calculate the depths of nodes `a` and `b` from the root.
   - Ensure `a` is the node with the smaller depth.
   - Move `b` up the tree until its depth matches `a`.
   - Move both `a` and `b` up the tree together until they meet at the LCA.
   - Calculate the length of the cycle by summing the depths of `a` and `b` and subtracting twice the depth of the LCA.
3. Append the calculated cycle length to the result list.
4. Return the result list containing the cycle lengths for each query.

This approach ensures that the LCA is found efficiently in \(O(\log n)\) time, making the overall solution suitable for large values of \(n\) and \(m\).

This solution works as follows:

   - Determine the start (`range_start`) and end (`range_end`) of the range `[range_start, range_end]` where numbers are not in the blacklist.
   - Move all numbers in the blacklist outside this range to the end of the range using a map (`index_map`).

2. **Move Blacklist Numbers**:
   - Create a map (`index_map`) to store the original index of each number in the range `[range_start, range_end]`.
   - Iterate over the `blacklist` and move each number outside the range to the end of the range. Update the `index_map` accordingly.

3. **Pick Function**:
   - Randomly select a number in the range `[range_start, range_end]`.

            adj_list[u].append(v)
            adj_list[v].append(u)
        
        # Initialize variables to keep track of visited nodes and connected components
        visited = [False] * n
        component_sizes = []

        def dfs(node):
            if visited[node]:
                return
            visited[node] = True
            component_sizes[-1] += 1
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                dfs(neighbor)

            if not visited[i]:
                component_sizes.append(0)
                dfs(i)

        total_pairs = 0
        for size in component_sizes:
            total_pairs += size * (n - size)
        
        return total_pairs // 2
```

**Explanation:** 
1. **Adjacency List Construction**: We create an adjacency list to represent the undirected graph. Each node points to its neighboring nodes.

2. **DFS Traversal**: We use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore each connected component of the graph. We mark visited nodes to avoid revisiting them and count the number of nodes in each component.

3. **Component Sizes**: We maintain a list `component_sizes` to store the sizes of all connected components.

4. **Calculate Unreachable Pairs**: For each component of size `size`, the number of unreachable pairs is `size * (n - size)`. We sum these values to get the total number of unreachable pairs.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return half of the total pairs, as each pair is counted twice. The result is divided by 2 to ensure each pair is counted only once. 

This approach efficiently finds the number of unreachable pairs by leveraging graph traversal and counting techniques. **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges. **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the adjacency

        return result
```

This solution iterates through the array while keeping track of the direction of the current turbulent subarray. If the current element is the same as the previous one, it resets the result. Otherwise, it checks if the direction matches the expected direction for the current pair. If it does not match, it resets the result to 2, indicating that the current subarray is not turbulent anymore. The result is updated accordingly, and the maximum length of the turbulent subarray is returned. This approach ensures that the solution efficiently finds the longest turbulent subarray in linear time. 

Please note that this solution assumes that the input array has at least two elements, as per the constraints. If the input array has fewer than two elements, the function returns 1, as a single-element subarray is trivially turbulent.

```


This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. The `dfs` function takes the current node and the current path as arguments. If the current node is `None`, it returns immediately. If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right children), it appends the current path (including the value of the node) to the `paths` list. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the left and right children, appending the current node's value and "->" to the path for each child. Finally, the `binaryTreePaths` method initializes an empty list `paths` and calls the `dfs` function starting from the root node with an empty path. The result is a list of all root-to-leaf paths.

This solution uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph formed by the points. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Calculate Edges**: We calculate the Manhattan distance between each pair of points and store them as edges in a list. Each edge is represented as a tuple `(weight, u, v)`, where `weight` is the distance, and `u` and `v` are the indices of the points.

2. **Sort Edges**: We sort the edges by their weights. This allows

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of a substring where the cost of changing the characters is within the given limit. It maintains a running total of the cost and adjusts the window size as needed to ensure the cost does not exceed the maximum allowed. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the strings, and the space complexity is O(1). This approach efficiently finds the longest valid substring by leveraging the properties of the sliding window technique. 

To verify the correctness of this solution, you can use the provided test cases:

```python
# Test cases
print(Solution().equalSubstring("abcd", "bcdf", 3))  # Output: 3
print(Solution().equalSubstring("abcd", "cdef", 3))  # Output: 1
print(Solution().equalSubstring("abcd", "acde", 0))  # Output: 1
```

These test cases cover various scenarios, including cases where the cost limit is exceeded and cases where the entire string can be changed. The solution should work correctly for the given constraints and examples.

**Additional Explanation:**

The sliding window technique is used here to efficiently find the longest substring with a cost within the limit. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` is the length of the strings `s` and `t`.
   - `res` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the maximum length of the valid substring.
   - `left` is initialized to 0 to mark the start of the current window.
   - `total_cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative cost of the current window.

2. **Iterate through the string:**
   - For each

        return dp[m-1][(1 << n) - 1]
```
This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of students that can be seated in the first `i+1` rows with the seating arrangement represented by `j`.

2. **Base Case**: For the first row, we initialize `dp[0][j]` to be the number of '.' characters in the row represented by `j`. This is because we can place students in any of the available seats.

3. **DP Transition**: For each row `i` and each possible seating arrangement `j`, we iterate over each column `k`. If the seat is available (`seats[i][k] == '.'`) and the student is not already seated (`(j >> k) & 1 == 0`), we update `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i-1][j | (1 << k)]`, where `|` denotes the bitwise OR operation. This means we can place a student in column `k` if it is available and we have previously seated students in the previous rows.

4. **Result**: The result is stored in `dp[m-1][(1 << n) - 1]`, which represents the maximum number of students that can be seated in the entire matrix with all rows occupied.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible seating arrangements and maximize the number of students while avoiding cheating. The constraints ensure that the problem size is manageable, allowing us to use this dynamic programming approach effectively. ```python

**Code solution:**

        for grain in grains:
            # Binary search for the nearest hen
            left, right = 0, len(hens) - 1
            while left <= right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if hens[mid] >= grain:

                else:

            # Calculate the time to reach the nearest hen
            time_to_nearest_hen = abs(grain - hens[left])

            min_time = min(min_time, time_to_nearest_hen)
        
        return min_time
```


This solution works as follows:

1. Sort both the `hens` and `grains` lists.
2. Initialize `min_time` to infinity to keep track of the minimum time required to eat all grains.
3. Iterate over each grain in the sorted `grains` list.
4. For each grain, perform a binary search to find the nearest hen to it. This is done by maintaining two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the current search range.
5. If the current hen is greater than or equal to the grain, move the `right` pointer to the left. Otherwise, move the `left` pointer to the right.
6. Once the binary search is complete, calculate the time to reach the nearest hen using the absolute difference between the grain and the nearest hen.
7. Update `min_time` with the minimum of its current value and the calculated time.
8. After iterating over all grains, return the `min_time`.

This approach ensures that we always move the nearest hen to the current grain, minimizing the total time required to eat all grains. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

3. After iterating through all numbers, `min_sum` will contain the smallest sum of the subarray starting from the beginning.

This implementation uses a simple randomization approach to select a random index for the target number. It maintains a count of occurrences of the target number and uses random selection to ensure that each index has an equal probability of being chosen. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
   - The constructor initializes the object with the input list `nums`.

2. **Random Selection (`pick` method):**
   - The `pick` method takes a `target` number as input and returns a random index where the target occurs.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to keep track of how many times the target number appears in the list.
   - It also initializes a variable `result` to store the selected index.
   - It iterates over the list `nums` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the value `num`.
   - If the current number matches the target, it increments the `count`.
   - It uses `random.randint(1, count)` to generate a random number between 1 and the count of the target number. If this number is 1, it updates the `result` with the current index `i`.
   - Finally, it returns the `result`, which is the random index of the target number.

This approach ensures that each index has an equal probability of being selected, as required by the problem constraints. The use of randomization makes the solution efficient even for large lists. Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications! ```python

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
```
**Solution Explanation:** 
To solve this problem, we need to construct the longest palindrome by concatenating subsequences from `word1` and `word2`. The approach involves using dynamic programming to find the longest palindromic subsequence within both substrings and then combining them appropriately.

Here's the implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        # Concatenate word1 and word2
        combined = word1 + word2
        
        # Get lengths of the original words
        len1, len2 = len(word1), len(word2)
        
        # Initialize DP table
        dp = [[0] * (len(combined)) for _ in range(len(combined))]
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for length in range(1, len(combined) + 1):
            for start in range(len(combined) - length + 1):
                end = start + length - 1
                
                # Check if the substring is a palindrome
                if combined[start] == combined[end]:
                    dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2
                else:
                    dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])
        
        # Find the longest palindromic subsequence in the concatenated string
        max_palindrome_length = 0
        
        # Check each substring in word1 and word2
        for i in range(len1):
            for j in range(len2):
                if combined[i] == combined[len1 + j]:
                    max_palindrome_length = max(max_palindrome_length, dp[i][i + len1 + j])
        
        return max_palindrome_length
```

### Explanation:

1. **Concatenation**: We concatenate `word1` and `word2` to simplify the problem. This allows us to treat the entire combined string as our main string, making it easier to find palindromic subsequences.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `combined[i:j+1]`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate

                score += grid[i][j] * (1 << (n - 1 - j))
        
        return score
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Toggle the first column**: If the first element of any row is 0, toggle all elements in that row to ensure the most significant bit is 1 for all rows.

2. **Toggle columns**: For each column starting from the second column, if the number of 0's is greater than the number of 1's, toggle all elements in that column to ensure the majority of 1's are in the higher bits.

3. **Calculate the score**: Convert each row to its decimal equivalent and sum them up to get the final score. Each bit position in the decimal number represents a power of 2, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit) as \(2^0\). ```python
```python
class Solution:
    def matrixScore(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

                    grid[i][j] ^= 1
        
        # Toggle columns if the number of 0's is more than 1's

        return dfs(bottomLeft.x, bottomLeft.y, topRight.x, topRight.y)
``` 

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: If the current rectangle is invalid (i.e., `x1 > x2` or `y1 > y2`), return 0 because there are no ships in this region.

2. **Check for Empty Rectangle**: If the current rectangle does not contain any ships (`not sea.hasShips(Point(x2, y2), Point(x1, y1))`), return 0.

3. **Single Point Check**: If the current rectangle contains exactly one ship (`x1 == x2 and y1 == y2`), return 1.

4. **Recursive Division**: Divide the current rectangle into four smaller rectangles and recursively count the number of ships in each of them:
   - Top-Right quadrant: `(mid_x + 1, y1, x2, mid_y)`
   - Top-Left quadrant: `(mid_x + 1, mid_y + 1, x2, y2)`
   - Bottom-Right quadrant: `(x1, mid_y + 1, mid_x, y2)`
   - Bottom-Left quadrant

                end = points[i][1]
        
        return arrows
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Sorting**: The points are sorted based on their end coordinates. This allows us to consider the balloons that are closest to each other first, which helps in minimizing the number of arrows needed.
2. **Initialization**: We initialize the number of arrows to 1 and set the end coordinate to the end of the first balloon.
3. **Iterating through the Points**: We iterate through the sorted points starting from the second balloon. For each balloon, if its start coordinate is greater than the end coordinate of the last arrow, we need to shoot another arrow, and we update the end coordinate to the end of the current balloon.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the number of arrows used.

This approach ensures that we minimize the number of arrows needed to burst all balloons by always shooting an arrow at the earliest possible position that can burst the next balloon. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

``` 
This solution works as follows:

1. If the `root` is `None`, it means the tree is empty, and we create a new node with the given value and return it.

2. We compare the `val` with the `root.val`:
   - If `val` is less than `root.val`, it means the new value should be inserted into the left subtree. We recursively call `insertIntoBST` on the left child of the `root`.

   - If `val` is greater than or equal to `root.val`, it means the new value should be inserted into the right subtree. We recursively call `insertIntoBST` on the right child of the `root`.

3. After inserting the new node, we return the modified `root`. This ensures that the tree remains a valid BST after the insertion.

class Solution:
    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return False
``` 

**Explanation**:

The function `isStrictlyPalindromic` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `False`. This is because for any integer `n`, it is impossible for the string representation of `n` in any base `b` between 2 and `n-2` to be palindromic. The reason for this is that the string representation of `n` in base `b` will always contain digits, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 4, it will always contain at least one digit other than 0. Therefore, the string representation of `n` in any base `b` between 2 and `n-2` will never be palindromic.

Therefore, the function simply returns `False` without performing any further calculations. 

Note that this solution is based on the mathematical fact that for any integer `n`, it is impossible for the string representation of `n` in any base `b` between 2 and `n-2` to be palindromic. However, it is worth noting that this solution does not actually perform any calculations to determine whether the string representation of `n` in any base `b` between 2 and `n-2` is palindromic. Instead, it simply returns `False` based on the mathematical fact mentioned above. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

        return total_read
```

In this solution, we use a buffer `_buf4` to read characters from the file using `read4`. We then copy the read characters to the output buffer `buf`. If the number of characters read is less than `n`, we continue reading until we have read `n` characters. Finally, we copy the characters from the buffer to the output buffer and return the number of characters read. Note that we reset the buffer pointer after each read to allow us to read more characters if needed. Also, we ensure that the output buffer is not larger than `n` characters to avoid overflow. This solution handles the case where the number of characters requested is less than the number of characters available in the file. Additionally, it handles the case where the file ends before we have read `n` characters. Finally, it resets the class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases.
