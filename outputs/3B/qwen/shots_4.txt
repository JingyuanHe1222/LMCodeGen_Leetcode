**Explanation:** 
1. We define a `PolyNode` class to represent each term in the polynomial linked list.
2. The `addPoly` function takes two polynomial linked list heads, `poly1` and `poly2`, and returns the head of the sum of the polynomials.
3. We create a dummy node to simplify the process of adding nodes to the result list.
4. We use a `while` loop to iterate through both `poly1` and `poly2` simultaneously.
5. We compare the powers of the current nodes in `poly1` and `poly2`.
   - If the power of the current node in `poly1` is greater than the power of the current node in `poly2`, we add the current node in `poly1` to the result list and move to the next node in `poly1`.
   - If the power of the current node in `poly1` is less than the power of the current node in `poly2`, we add the current node in `poly2` to the result list and move to the next node in `poly2`.
   - If the powers are equal, we

```


This solution works as follows:

1. We define a helper function `calculate_beauty` that takes a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each character in the substring and calculates the beauty of the substring.

2. We initialize a variable `total_beauty` to store the sum of the beauties of all substrings.

3. We iterate over all possible starting points of the substrings using a nested loop. For each starting point, we initialize a `Counter` object to keep track of the frequency of each character in the current substring.

4. We iterate over all possible ending points of the substrings starting from the current starting point. For each ending point, we update the frequency of the current character in the `Counter` object and calculate the beauty of the substring using the `calculate_beauty` function.

5. We add the beauty of the current substring to the `total_beauty` variable.

6. Finally, we return the `total_beauty` variable. This gives us the sum of the beauties of all substrings in the input string.

``` 

This solution uses a graph-based approach to determine if the people can be split into two groups such that no two people who dislike each other are in the same group. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to color the graph, assigning a color to each node and ensuring that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If a node is already colored and the color doesn't match the expected color, the graph cannot be bipartite. The solution returns `True` if the graph can be bipartite and `False` otherwise. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(N + E), where N is the number of people and E is the number of dislikes, as we need to build the graph and perform DFS on each node. The space complexity is O(N + E) due to the storage of the graph and the color array. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

This solution works by creating a set from the characters in the input sentence. Since sets automatically handle duplicates, if the size of the set is 26, it means all 26 letters of the alphabet are present in the sentence, making it a pangram. Otherwise, it returns False. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

This solution works by first counting the frequency of each barcode using `Counter`. It then creates a max heap based on negative frequencies to simulate a min heap. The heap is populated with tuples of negative frequency and barcode code.

The algorithm then repeatedly pops the most frequent barcode from the heap and adds it to the result. After adding a barcode, it decrements its frequency and pushes it back to the heap if it's still greater than zero.

To ensure no two adjacent barcodes are equal, the algorithm checks if the last added barcode is the same as the previous one. If so, it adds another barcode from the heap if possible.

This process continues until the heap is empty, resulting in a rearranged list of barcodes where no two adjacent barcodes are equal. ``` ``` ```python

This solution checks all possible combinations of the first two numbers in the sequence and then verifies if the rest of the sequence forms an additive sequence by recursively checking if each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The function `isValid` checks if the sum of two numbers equals the next number in the sequence and handles cases where the numbers might have leading zeros. The solution iterates over all possible lengths for the first two numbers and checks if they form an additive sequence. If it finds such a sequence, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. ``` ``` ```python

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`. It maintains two counters: `t_counter` for the target string `t` and `window_counter` for the current window in `s`. The algorithm expands the window by moving the right pointer and shrinks it by moving the left pointer. The window is considered valid when it contains all characters of `t` with their respective counts. The algorithm keeps track of the smallest valid window found and returns it. The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m is the length of `s` and n is the length of `t`. The space complexity is O(min(m, n)) due to the counters. The follow-up requirement of achieving O(m + n) time complexity can be achieved by using a hash map to store the character counts of `t` and updating it dynamically as the window is expanded and shrunk. However, this approach may increase the space complexity to O(n).

    The algorithm uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the smallest number of swaps required to transform `s1` into `s2`. The algorithm uses a queue to store the current state of the string and the number of swaps performed so far. The visited set is used to keep track of the states that have already been processed to avoid redundant calculations.

In each iteration of the BFS, the algorithm checks if the current state is equal to `s2`. If it is, the number of swaps performed so far is returned as the result.

If the current state is not equal to `s2`, the algorithm iterates through each character in the string. If the current character matches the corresponding character in `s2`, the algorithm skips to the next character. Otherwise, the algorithm tries to find a matching character in the remaining part of the string. If a match is found, the algorithm swaps the current character with the matching character and adds the new state to the queue along with the incremented number of swaps.

The process continues until the queue is empty or the target state is reached. If the target state is not reached, the algorithm returns -1.

    The solution class defines a method `maxNumEdgesToRemove` that takes in two parameters: `nums`, a list of integers representing the values of the nodes, and `edges`, a list of lists representing the edges in the tree.

The solution uses two Union-Find data structures, `uf1` and `uf2`, to keep track of the connected components in the tree. The `UnionFind` class is defined to perform union-find operations efficiently.

The algorithm iterates through each edge in the `edges` list. If the edge is of type A (i.e., both nodes have the same value), it attempts to union the two nodes using `uf1`. If successful, it increments the `remove_count` to indicate that the edge can be removed.

If the edge is of type B (i.e., the sum of the values of the two nodes is 51), it attempts to union the two nodes using `uf2`. If successful, it increments the `remove_count`.

After processing all the edges, the algorithm checks if both `uf1` and `uf2` are connected. If they are not connected, it means it is not possible to split the tree into connected components with  7%|â–‹         | 2/30 [00:28<06:32, 14.01s/it]

This solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the boundaries of the black region. The BFS starts from the given coordinates `(x, y)` and explores all connected black pixels. During the exploration, it updates the boundaries (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) of the black region. Finally, it calculates the area of the smallest rectangle that encloses all black pixels by multiplying the width and height of the region. The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n) in the worst case, but it ensures less than O(m * n) runtime complexity due to the BFS traversal. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

This solution first checks if the input string contains an '@' symbol, which indicates that it is an email address. If it is, the `mask_email` method is called to mask the email address according to the specified rules. If the input string does not contain an '@' symbol, it is assumed to be a phone number, and the `mask_phone` method is called to mask the phone number according to the specified rules.

        return dp[steps][0]
```
This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. We maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to be at index `j` after `i` steps. The base case is when there is one way to stay at index 0 after 0 steps. We then fill the DP table by considering three possible moves: staying at the same position, moving one step to the right, and moving one step to the left. Finally, we return the number of ways to be at index 0 after `steps` steps. The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers. Note that the maximum possible value of `j` is `steps // 2` because if `j` is greater than `steps // 2`, it would be impossible to return to index 0 after `steps` steps. Therefore, we limit the size of the DP table accordingly.

```

This solution works as follows:

1. We count the number of '0's and '1's in the string using `Counter`.

2. If the counts are the same, it's impossible to make the string alternating, so we return half the length of the string.

3. We calculate the minimum operations needed for both alternating patterns:
   - For the pattern starting with '0': We count the number of '0's at even indices and the number of '1's at odd indices.
   - For the pattern starting with '1': We count the number of '1's at even indices and the number of '0's at odd indices.

4. We return the minimum of the two possible patterns. ```python

        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Build the graph
        for u, v in paths:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)

            result[i - 1] = available_colors.pop()
        
        return result
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Graph Construction**: We build an adjacency list representation of the graph using the `paths` array. Each garden is a node, and each path is an edge connecting two nodes.

2. **Result Initialization**: We initialize a result array `result` of size `n` with all values set to 0. This array will store the flower type for each garden.

3. **Processing Each Garden**: We iterate through each garden from 1 to `n`. For each garden, we determine the available colors by considering the flower types of its adjacent gardens.

4. **Color Assignment**: We assign the first available color to the current garden from the set of available colors. We remove this color from the set of available colors for future gardens.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `result` array containing the flower types for each garden. This ensures that no two adjacent gardens have the same flower type.

This solution works as follows:

1. **Graph Construction**: We build an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.

2. **Subtree XOR Calculation**: We define a helper function `xor_sum` that calculates the XOR sum of all nodes in a subtree rooted at a given node. This function uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore all nodes in the subtree and accumulates their XOR values.

3. **Subtree XOR Array**: We calculate the XOR sum for each subtree and store these values in an array `subtree_xors`.

4. **Sorting**: We sort the `subtree_xors` array in ascending order to facilitate finding the maximum XOR between two non-overlapping subtrees.

5. **Finding Maximum XOR**: We iterate over all pairs of subtrees and compute their XOR. We keep track of the maximum XOR value found.

6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the maximum XOR value.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the XOR sums of all subtrees and find the maximum XOR between two non-overlapping subtrees. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it suitable for large 10%|â–ˆ         | 3/30 [00:41<06:16, 13.96s/it]

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort Items**: The items are sorted based on their price-to-weight ratio in descending order. This ensures that we prioritize items with the highest value per unit weight.

2. **Initialize Total Price**: We initialize `total_price` to accumulate the total price of items that fit within the capacity.

3. **Iterate Through Items**: We iterate through each item in the sorted list:
   - If the remaining capacity is zero, we break out of the loop.
   - If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the remaining capacity, we add the full price of the item to `total_price` and reduce the capacity accordingly.
   - If the weight of the current item is greater than the remaining capacity, we calculate the fraction of the item that can fit within the remaining capacity and add the corresponding price to `total_price`. We then set the remaining capacity to zero.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `total_price`, which represents the maximum total price to fill the bag with the given items within the specified capacity. If it is impossible to fill the bag, the function will naturally return `-1` due to the condition `if capacity == 0`.

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and count the occurrences of each character label in the subtree rooted at each node. The algorithm maintains a `graph` dictionary to represent the adjacency list of the tree, and a `result` list to store the counts of each character label in the subtree rooted at each node.

The `dfs` function performs a DFS traversal of the tree, starting from the root node (node 0). For each node, it initializes a `counts` list of size 26 to store the counts of each character label in the subtree rooted at the node. The count of the character label at the current node is incremented by 1.

For each child node of the current node, if the child node is not the parent node, the function recursively calls the `dfs` function on the child node. The counts of the character labels in the subtree rooted at the child node are obtained from the recursive call, and they are added to the `counts` list of the current node.

Finally, the count of the character label at the current node is stored in the `result` list, and the `counts` list of the current node is returned.

The algorithm runs as long as there are nodes left in the tree. Once all the nodes have been processed, the `result` list contains the desired output.

This solution works as follows:

1. **Union-Find Initialization**: We initialize a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the connected components in the graph. Each node is initially its own parent.

2. **Union Function**: The `union` function merges two sets by finding their roots and linking them.

3. **Find Function**: The `find` function finds the root of a node using path compression to optimize future operations.

4. **Result Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to store the outcomes of each friend request.

5. **Processing Each Request**: For each request `(u, v)`:
   - If `u` and `v` are the same, the request is successful because they are already friends.
   - If `u` and `v` are already in the same component, the request is successful because they are already friends.
   - Otherwise, we check if the request violates any restriction. If it does, the request is not successful.
   - If the request does not violate any restriction, we merge the components of `u` and `v` and mark the request as successful.

6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `result` list containing the outcomes of all friend requests.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that all friend requests are processed correctly based on the given restrictions. The

```

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. We maintain a DP table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of books that can be taken from the first `i` shelves. For each shelf `i`, we calculate the maximum number of books that can be taken by considering the sum of books from shelf `i` to the end and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. We then update the DP table by taking the maximum value between the current value and the maximum number of books that can be taken from shelf `i` by taking strictly fewer books from shelf `i` than shelf `i + 1`. Finally, we return the maximum value in the DP table. This approach ensures that we consider all possible contiguous sections of the bookshelf and find the maximum number of books that can be taken. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, but it can be optimized further using prefix sums or other techniques. However, for the given constraints, this solution should work efficiently. Let me know if you

This solution works by using two pointers, `i` and `j`, to represent the current prefix and suffix of the string. It then iteratively checks if the characters at these pointers are equal. If they are, it moves the pointers inward, skipping over any consecutive equal characters. If they are not equal, it breaks out of the loop and returns the length of the remaining substring. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(1). 

Here's a breakdown of how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to represent the current prefix and suffix of the string. Set `i` to the beginning of the string and `j` to the end of the string.

2. While `i` is less than `j`, check if the characters at `i` and `j` are equal.

3. If they are equal, move the pointers inward, skipping over any consecutive equal characters. Specifically, increment `i` while `i + 1 < j` and `s[i] == s[i + 1]`, and decrement `j` while `j - 1 > i` and `s[j] == s[j - 1]`.

4. If the characters at `i` and `j` are not equal, break out of the loop.

5. Return the length of the remaining substring, which is `j - i + 1`.

This solution ensures that we find the minimum length of the string after performing the specified operations. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(1).

This solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths in the grid. The `dfs` function checks if the current cell matches the current character in the word. If it does, the function recursively explores all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). If a path leads to the end of the word, the function returns `True`. If no path leads to the end of the word, the function backtracks and tries the next possible path. The solution iterates over all cells in the grid and calls the `dfs` function for each cell, returning `True` if any path leads to the end of the word. If no path leads to the end of the word after exploring all cells, the function returns `False`. The use of the `#` character marks visited cells to avoid revisiting them during the search. This ensures that each cell is only visited once. The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n * 4^k), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid, and k is the length of the word. The space complexity is O(k) for the recursion stack.

    The algorithm uses a recursive approach to trim the binary search tree. It checks if the current node's value is less than the `low` boundary or greater than the `high` boundary. If it is, the function returns the trimmed subtree rooted at the left or right child, respectively.

If the current node's value is within the range `[low, high]`, the function recursively trims the left and right subtrees and updates the current node's left and right pointers accordingly. Finally, the function returns the current node. This ensures that the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree is maintained. 
    
*** Leetcode Example Question 5 ***
Given a binary tree and an integer `k`, return _the number of paths in the tree such that the sum of the values along the path equals_ `k`.

A path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1\], k = 8
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The paths that sum to 8 are highlighted in yellow.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[5,0,1,1,null,4,null,7\], k = 2
**Output:** 2

This implementation uses a boolean array to represent the hash set. The size of the array is set to 1000001, which is large enough to accommodate the given constraints. The `add` method sets the corresponding element in the array to `True`, indicating that the key is present. The `remove` method sets the corresponding element to `False`, indicating that the key is removed. The `contains` method simply returns the value of the corresponding element in the array, which indicates whether the key is present or not. This approach ensures that all operations (add, remove, and contains) are performed in constant time. ```python

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` equal.

The base cases are when one of the strings is empty. In this case, the minimum ASCII sum is the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the other string.

For each character in `s1` and `s2`, the algorithm checks if they are equal. If they are, the minimum ASCII sum is the same as the minimum ASCII sum of the first `i-1` characters of `s1` and the first `j-1` characters of `s2`. If they are not equal, the algorithm considers two options: deleting the current character from `s1` or deleting the current character from `s2`. The minimum ASCII sum is the minimum of these two options.

Finally, the algorithm returns `dp[m][n

This solution converts the `2 x 3` board into a single string for easier manipulation. It defines the possible moves and initializes a queue with the initial state and the number of moves. The algorithm performs BFS to explore all possible states, checking if the current state is the goal state. If a solution is found, it returns the number of moves; otherwise, it returns -1. The `visited` set is used to avoid redundant calculations and

        nums = [start + 2 * i for i in range(n)]
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x ^ y, nums)
```
This solution works as follows:

1. We create an array `nums` where each element is calculated as `start + 2 * i` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
2. We use the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to apply the XOR operation (`^`) cumulatively to all elements in the `nums` array.
3. The result of the cumulative XOR operation is returned as the output. This is because XORing a number with itself results in `0`, and XORing `0` with any number results in the number itself. Therefore, the XOR of all elements in the `nums` array will be the same as the XOR of the first element in the array, which is `start`. However, in this case, we need to consider the entire array, so we use `reduce` to perform the XOR operation cumulatively.    
*** Leetcode Example Question 5 ***
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.

Return _the maximum sum of any non-empty subarray of_ `nums` **such that** the length of the subarray is at most_ `k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,15,7,9\], k = 3
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The length of the subarray is at most 3, so we return the maximum sum of any subarray of length at most 3.
The subarrays of length 3 are \[1,15,7\], \[15,7,9\], and \[7,9,1\]. The maximum sum is 23.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[5, -2, 3, 1, 2, -1\], k = 4
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** The length of the subarray is at most 4, so we return the maximum sum of any subarray of length at most

        return min_length
``` 
This solution works as follows:

1. Calculate the required number of occurrences for each character ('Q', 'W', 'E', 'R') in the string. Since the string is balanced, each character should appear exactly `n // 4` times.

2. Use a counter to keep track of the current count of each character in the string.

3. If the current string is already balanced, return 0.

4. Initialize `min_length` to the length of the string and `start` and `end` pointers to 0.

5. Use a sliding window approach to find the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced to make the string balanced.

6. Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer to the right and decrementing the count of the character at the `end` pointer.

7. If the current window contains characters that appear at least `required` times, update `min_length` and move the `start` pointer to the right to shrink the window.

8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the `end` pointer reaches the end of the string.

9. Return `min_length` as the result.

    def reset(self) -> None:
        self.flipped_cells.clear()
        self.total_cells = self.m * self.n
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
   - We initialize the number of rows (`m`) and columns (`n`) of the matrix.
   - We calculate the total number of cells (`total_cells`) in the matrix.
   - We use a set (`flipped_cells`) to keep track of the cells that have been flipped.

2. **Flipping a Cell (`flip` method):**
   - We generate a random cell index between 0 and `total_cells - 1`.
   - We check if the generated cell index has already been flipped. If not, we flip it by adding it to the `flipped_cells` set and return its coordinates as a list `[row, col]`.

3. **Resetting the Matrix (`reset` method):**
   - We clear the `flipped_cells` set to reset all cells to 0.
   - We update the `total_cells` to reflect the original number of cells in the matrix.

This solution ensures that each cell has an equal probability of being selected for flipping, and it minimizes the number of calls to the built-in random function. The time complexity of the `flip` method is O(1) on average, and the space complexity is O(m * n) for storing the flipped cells. The `reset` method resets the state in O(1) time. The constraints are handled efficiently, and the solution is optimized for the given problem requirements.

This solution works as follows:

1. Calculate the total sum of all chalk values.
2. Reduce `k` modulo the total sum to handle cases where `k` is greater than the total sum of chalk.
3. Initialize `current_sum` to 0.
4. Iterate through the `chalk` list:
   - Add the current chalk value to `current_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` exceeds `k`, return the current index `i` as the student who will replace the chalk.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the student who will replace the chalk by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and prefix sums. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the `chalk` list, and the space complexity is O(1).````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

            else:
                prefix_sum_count[prefix_sum] = 1

        return count
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize `prefix_sum` to keep track of the running sum of the elements in the array, `count` to store the number of subarrays with sum `k`, and `prefix_sum_count` to store the count of each prefix sum encountered so far.

2. We iterate through each element in the array `nums`.

3. For each element, we update `prefix_sum` by adding the current element to it.

4. If `prefix_sum - k` is already in `prefix_sum_count`, it means there exists a subarray ending at the current element whose sum is `k`. We increment `count` by the count of `prefix_sum - k` in `prefix_sum_count`.

5. We then update `prefix_sum_count` to include the current `prefix_sum`. If `prefix_sum` is not already in `prefix_sum_count`, we add it with a count of 1. If it is already present, we increment its count by 1.

6. Finally, we return the value of `count`, which represents the total number of subarrays with sum `k`. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. It efficiently counts the number of subarrays with sum `k` using a hash map to keep track of prefix sums.

``` 
This Python implementation uses a backtracking approach to generate all permutations of the input list `nums`. The `permute` method initializes the result list and calls the `backtrack` method to explore all possible permutations. The `backtrack` method takes three parameters: the remaining numbers to permute (`nums`), the current permutation path (`path`), and the result list (`result`). It recursively explores each number in the remaining list, adding it to the current path and removing it from the list of remaining numbers. When a path is complete (i.e., all numbers have been used), it is added to the result list. The process continues until all permutations have been generated. This approach ensures that all permutations are generated without duplicates and in any order.

class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        # Count the frequency of each character in both strings
        s_count = Counter(s)

```
    
    This solution works as follows:

1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in both strings `s` and `t`.

2. We initialize a variable `steps` to keep track of the number of steps needed to make the two strings anagrams.

3. We iterate through the characters in `s_count`. For each character, we check if it exists in `t_count`. If it does, we calculate the absolute difference in their frequencies and add it to `steps`. If it doesn't, we add the frequency of the character in `s_count` to `steps`.

4. We repeat the same process for the characters in `t_count`. If a character exists in `s_count`, we skip it. Otherwise, we add its frequency to `steps`.

5. Finally, we return the value of `steps`, which represents the minimum number of steps needed to make the two strings anagrams.

This solution iterates through each row and column of the matrix. For each row, it checks if there is exactly one '1'. If so, it then checks if all other elements in that row and column are '0'. If both conditions are met, it increments the `special_count`. Finally, it returns the count of special positions. ``` ``` ```python

This solution works as follows:

1. We use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each feature in the `responses`.

2. We iterate over each response and split it into individual words.

3. For each word in the response, if it is a feature, we increment its count in the `feature_counts` dictionary.

4. After counting the occurrences of each feature, we sort the `features` list based on their popularity (count) in descending order. If two features have the same popularity, they maintain their original order due to the stable sorting behavior of the `sorted` function.

5. Finally, we return the sorted list of features.

1. We create a dictionary `pos` to store the positions of each value in `nums2`.

2. We use a prefix sum array `inc` to store the number of increasing subsequences ending at each position. For each position `i`, we add 1 to the number of increasing subsequences if the value at position `i` is greater than the value at position `i-1`.

3. Similarly, we use a suffix sum array `dec` to store the number of decreasing subsequences starting at each position. For each position `i`, we add 1 to the number of decreasing subsequences if the value at position `i` is less than the value at position `i+1`.

4. We iterate over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` and count the number of good triplets. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is good if `i < j < k`, `pos[nums1[i]] <

``` 
    
    This solution calculates the minimum number of operations required to move all balls to each box by considering the initial state of the boxes. It uses two arrays, `left_operations` and `right_operations`, to store the number of operations required to move all balls to the left and right of each box, respectively. The `total_left` and `total_right` variables keep track of the total number of balls to the left and right of the current box, respectively. The final result is obtained by adding the values in `left_operations` and `right_operations` for each box. This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is calculated efficiently.

        # Check if nodes are connected for each query
        return [find(i) == find(j) for i, j in queries]
```
    
    The algorithm uses a Union-Find data structure to efficiently manage the connections between cities based on their common divisors. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We initialize a parent array to represent the Union-Find structure. Each city is initially its own parent.

2. **Connect Nodes**: We iterate over each city `i` starting from `threshold + 1` to `n`. For each city `i`, we connect it to all other cities `j` that are multiples of `i` (i.e., `j = i * 2, i * 3, ..., n` where `i * j <= n`). This ensures that all cities with a common divisor greater than the threshold are connected.

3. **Check Connectivity**: For each query `[i, j]`, we use the `find` function to determine the root of the Union-Find structure for both cities `i` and `j`. If the roots are the same, it means that the cities are connected, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that the connections are efficient and that we can quickly determine if two cities are connected using the Union-Find operations. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the union-find operations, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the parent array. The solution handles the constraints effectively and

            if shift == 0:
                continue
            shifts[shift - 1] += 26

                return False
        
        return True
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Check Lengths**: First, it checks if the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False` because conversion is only possible if both strings have the same length.

2. **Initialize Shift Array**: It initializes an array `shifts` of size 26 (one for each letter of the alphabet) to keep track of the cumulative shifts needed for each character.

3. **Iterate Through Strings**: It iterates through each character in `s` and calculates the shift required to convert the character to the corresponding character in `t`. The shift is calculated as `(ord(t[i]) - ord(s[i])) % 26`.

4. **Handle Zero Shifts**: If the shift is zero, it means the characters are already the same, so no shift is needed.

5. **Update Shift Array**: If the shift is not zero, it updates the corresponding index in the `shifts` array. The index is adjusted by subtracting 1 because the array is 0-indexed.

6. **Check Cumulative Shifts**: After updating the `shifts` array, it checks if the cumulative shift exceeds `k`. If it does, it returns `False` because it is not possible to convert `s` into `t` within the given number of moves.

7. **Return Result**: If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating that it is possible to convert `s` into `t` within the given number of moves.

This solution works by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning. For each element, it checks if it is greater than the next element. If it is, it calculates the number of splits needed to reduce the current element to a value less than or equal to the next element. The number of splits is determined by dividing the difference between the current element and the next element by the next element and rounding up. The result is added to the total number of operations. The current element is then updated to be the largest possible value after splitting. This process continues until the entire array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The final result is the total number of operations needed to sort the array. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space. The solution handles the constraints efficiently and provides the correct output for the given test cases.

    The algorithm uses two separate functions, `inorder`, to perform in-order traversal on both `root1` and `root2` and store the values in two lists, `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

The `twoSumBSTs` function then initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse `nums1` and `nums2` from the beginning and end, respectively. It checks the sum of the values at the current positions of `i` and `j` in `nums1` and `nums2`.

If the sum is equal to the target, it returns `True`. If the sum is less than the target, it increments `i` to try a larger value. If the sum is greater than the target, it decrements `j` to try a smaller value.

If the loop completes without finding a pair that sums to the target, it returns `False`.

    The algorithm checks if the given string `s` is a palindrome. If it is, it can be removed in a single step, so the function returns 1. If the string is not a palindrome, it can be reduced to a single character 'a' or 'b', so the function returns 2. The function first checks if the string is empty, in which case it returns 0. Then, it checks if the string is a palindrome using slicing (`s[::-1]`). If it is, it returns 1. If not, it returns 2. The function uses a simple check to determine if the string is a palindrome and returns the appropriate result based on the check. The function handles both empty strings and non-palindrome strings efficiently.

This solution calculates the total sum of the array and iterates through the array while maintaining a running left sum. For each index, it checks if the left sum equals the remaining sum (total sum minus the left sum minus the current number). If it does, the current index is the middle index, and the function returns it. If no such index is found, the function returns -1. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

In this solution, we use dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem. The `dfs` function computes whether Alice wins for a given tree size `n` by recursively determining the outcomes for smaller trees. We store the results in a dictionary `memo` to avoid redundant calculations. The base cases handle sizes 1 and 2 directly, returning `False` and `True` respectively. For larger sizes, we consider two scenarios: when `n` is even and when `n` is odd. Depending on these scenarios, we recursively call `dfs` on half of `n` and negate the result for odd `n`. Finally, we return the result for the given tree size `n`. The `fibTreeGame` method initializes the memoization dictionary and calls the `dfs` function to determine the winner for the tree with size `n`. The function returns `True` if Alice wins and `False` if Bob wins, assuming both players play optimally. The constraints are handled by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 100, which is the upper limit for the given problem.

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `result` to 0, which will store the total number of submatrices with all ones.

2. Iterate over each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix `mat`.

3. If the cell contains a `0`, skip it since it cannot form a submatrix with all ones.

4. For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the number of submatrices ending at that cell by considering all possible heights from the top to the current row `i`.

5. To calculate the height, iterate from the current row `i` to the top row `k` (inclusive) and count the number of consecutive `1`s. This count represents the height of the submatrices ending at `(i, j)`.

6. Add the height to `result` for each valid submatrix found.

7. Finally, return the total count stored in `result`. This count represents the number of submatrices with all ones in the given matrix.

This solution works by first sorting the array in descending order.

The solution iterates through the sorted array and adds the largest even numbers and odd numbers to the respective sums, decrementing `k` each time. If `k` becomes 0, the loop breaks. After the loop, if `k` is still greater than 0, the solution adds the smallest odd numbers to the even_sum. Finally, the solution checks if the even_sum is less than the odd_sum, and if so, swaps them. If the even_sum is still less than the odd_sum, the solution

        second_min = dfs(root)
        return second_min if second_min != float('inf') else -1
```


This solution works as follows:

1. We define a helper function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search on the tree.
2. In the `dfs` function, if the current node is `None`, we return infinity (`float('inf')`) because there is no value to compare.
3. If the current node's value is greater than the root's value, we return the current node's value because it is the second minimum value.
4. Otherwise, we return the minimum of the values obtained from the left and right subtrees.
5. We initialize `second_min` to the result of the `dfs` function starting from the root.
6. If `second_min` is still infinity, it means there is no second minimum value, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return `second_min`.

This approach ensures that we find the second minimum value efficiently by leveraging the properties of the special binary tree. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and the space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. The solution handles the constraints and examples provided.

    The algorithm initializes a dictionary `count` to store the occurrences of each element in the array. It then iterates through the array, updating the count for each element in the dictionary. After counting, it finds the element with the highest count using the `max` function and returns it. This solution works in linear time, O(n), and uses O(n) space for storing the counts. However, the follow-up constraint asks for an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses O(1) space, which is not achievable with a simple hash table due to the requirement to store counts. The provided solution meets the given constraints but does not satisfy the follow-up requirement. To achieve the follow-up constraint, a different approach, such as the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, would be needed. Here is how you can implement the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize two variables to store the candidate and its count
        candidate = None
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate through the array to find the majority element
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)
        
        return candidate
```

This solution uses a single pass through the array, achieving linear time, O(n), and constant space, O(1). The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm works by maintaining a candidate for the majority element and a count. It updates the candidate and count based on whether the current element matches the candidate or not. The candidate with the highest count at the end of the iteration is the majority element. This approach ensures that the majority element is found in linear

def majority_element(nums):
    count = 0

This solution uses a graph to represent the relationships between the variables in the equations. Each node in the graph represents a variable, and each edge represents a relationship between two variables with a corresponding weight. The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search starting from a given node, and checks if there is a cycle in the graph. If a cycle is found, it indicates a contradiction in the equations. The `checkContradictions` function checks each equation for contradictions by performing a DFS starting from each variable. If a contradiction is found in any equation, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the solution assumes that the input equations are consistent, i.e., no two equations contradict each other. If the input equations are inconsistent, the solution will return `True` even though there is no contradiction in the equations. In that case, you can modify the solution to handle inconsistent equations appropriately.

This solution uses a sliding window approach with a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the current window. The window is expanded by moving the right pointer and contracted by moving the left pointer when the number of distinct characters exceeds two. The maximum length of the substring with at most two distinct characters is updated accordingly. ``` ``` ```python

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to find the parent and depth of the nodes with values `x` and `y` in the binary tree. 

The `dfs` function is a recursive function that takes a node, its parent node, and the current depth as arguments. If the current node is `None`, it returns `False`. If the current node's value is equal to `x` or `y`, it returns a tuple containing the parent node and the current depth. If not, the recursion continues for the left and right children. The `dfs` function runs as long as there are nodes left in the tree. Once both nodes are found, the depths and parents of the nodes are compared. If the depths are equal and the parents are different, the nodes are cousins, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Code solution:**

        seen = set()

    This solution uses a set to keep track of the numbers that have been seen so far. As we iterate through the array, we check if the current number is already in the set. If it is, we check if the current index is within `k` positions of the last occurrence of the number. If it is, we return `True`. If not, we add the current number to the set and continue iterating through the array. If we finish iterating through the array without finding any duplicates within `k` positions, we return `False`. 
    
    The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(min(n, k)), where k is the maximum distance between the two duplicate numbers. This is because the set will contain at most `min(n, k)` elements at any time. The reason for this is that as we iterate through the array, we remove the oldest elements from the set when we encounter a new duplicate number that is within `k` positions of the last occurrence of the number.

This solution works by using a sliding window approach to compare the character counts of the current window in `s2` with the character count of `s1`. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to efficiently count the characters in both strings. The algorithm maintains a window of size equal to `s1` in `s2` and updates the character counts as the window slides over `s2`. If at any point the character counts match, it means that a permutation of `s1` is present in `s2`. The algorithm returns `True` if such a permutation is found, otherwise it returns `False`. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of `s2`, and the space complexity is O(1) since the character counts are limited to the 26 lowercase English letters. Note that this solution assumes that `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters. If the input strings can contain uppercase letters or other characters, additional modifications would be required to handle those cases. Also, if the input strings can be very large, additional optimizations such as using a hash table to store the character counts might be necessary to improve the performance. Here is the updated solution:

This solution works by generating all possible binary strings of length `n` and adding them to a set. It then iterates through the set of unique binary strings from `nums` and returns the first binary string that is not present in the set. This ensures that the returned binary string is different from all the strings in `nums`. ``` ``` ```python

```
**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
   - Initializes an empty list `stack` to store the elements.

2. **Push Operation (`push`)**:
   - Appends the given integer `x` to the end of the `stack`.

3. **Pop Operation (`pop`)**:
   - Removes and returns the last element from the `stack`.

4. **Top Operation (`top`)**:
   - Returns the last element of the `stack` without removing it.

5. **Peek Max Operation (`peekMax`)**:
   - Returns the maximum value in the `stack` using the built-in `max` function.

6. **Pop Max Operation (`popMax`)**:
   - Finds the maximum value in the `stack`.
   - Iterates through the stack in reverse order to find the first occurrence of the maximum value.
   - Deletes the maximum value from the `stack`.
   - Returns the maximum value found.

This implementation ensures that the `popMax` operation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack. However, the other operations (`push`, `pop`, `top`, `peekMax`) have a time complexity of O(1) as required. Here's the complete code:

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize two arrays, `max_left` and `min_right`, both of size `len(arr)`. These arrays will help us determine the maximum value on the left side of each index and the minimum value on the right side of each index, respectively.

2. We fill the `max_left` array by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far.

3. We fill the `min_right` array by iterating through the array in reverse order and keeping track of the minimum value encountered so far.

4. Finally, we iterate through the array and count the number of chunks. A chunk is valid if the maximum value on the left side of the chunk is less than or equal to the minimum value on the right side of the chunk.

5. We return the count of chunks as the result. ``` ``` ```python
class Solution:
    def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        max_left = [0] * len(arr)

        else:

```

This solution works by recursively parsing the ternary expression. It finds the position of the '?' character from the end of the string and checks the preceding character to determine whether to take the value before or after the '?'. The recursion continues until the base case is reached, where the expression is a single character, which is returned directly. ``` ``` ```python
class Solution:
    def parseTernary(self, expression: str) -> str:
        while len(expression) > 1:
            question_pos = expression.rfind('?')

                expression = expression[:question_pos - 1] + expression[question_pos + 1:]
        return expression
```

This solution uses a while loop to repeatedly find and process '?' characters from the end of the string. It updates the expression by removing the '?' and the subsequent characters based on the condition before the '?' until only one character remains, which is returned as the result. ``` ``` ```python
class Solution:
    def parseTernary(self, expression: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        
        for char in expression:
            if char != ':':
                stack.append(char)

                stack.append('T' if stack.pop() == 'T' else 'F')
        
        return stack[0]
```

This solution uses a stack to process the ternary expression. It iterates over each character in the expression, pushing characters onto the stack unless they are ':', in which case it pops two characters from the stack and appends 'T' or 'F' based

This solution initializes a `LogSystem` object with an empty list to store logs and a dictionary `granularity_map` to map each granularity string to its corresponding number of characters to consider for comparison. The `put` method stores a log as a tuple `(id, timestamp)` in the `logs` list. The `retrieve` method retrieves the IDs of logs whose timestamps fall within the specified range, considering the specified granularity by truncating the timestamps to the appropriate number of characters. The result is a list of log IDs that match the criteria. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!

1. We create a dummy node with a value of 0 and link it to the head of the list. This helps in handling edge cases where the smallest element needs to be inserted at the beginning of the list.

2. We initialize three pointers: `dummy`, `current`, and `previous`. `dummy` points to the head of the list, `current` points to the second node, and `previous` points to the first node.

3. We iterate through the list using the `current` pointer. For each node, we compare its value with the value of the node pointed by `previous`.

4. If the value of the current node is less than the value of the node pointed by `previous`, it means the current node needs to be inserted before the node pointed by `previous`. We adjust the pointers accordingly to insert the current node in the correct position.

5. If the value of the current node is greater than or equal to the value of the node pointed by `previous`, we simply move the `previous` pointer to the next node.

6. After iterating through the entire list, we return the next node of the dummy node, which is the head of the sorted list. 

This solution ensures that the list is sorted in-place with a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the list. However, in practice, the average time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops. The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a few extra pointers.

```
This code defines a solution class `Solution` with a method `partition` that takes a string `s` as input and returns all possible palindrome partitions of the string. The solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions and collect valid ones.

The `backtrack` method is a helper function that takes three parameters: `res` (the list to store the result), `s` (the remaining substring to partition), and `path` (the current partition being built). The method works as follows:

1. If the remaining substring `s` is empty, it means a complete partition has been found, so the current partition `path` is appended to the result list `res`.

2. The method then iterates over possible lengths of substrings starting from length 1 to the length of the remaining substring `s`. For each substring, it checks if the substring is a palindrome using slicing (`s[:i] == s[:i][::-1]`).

3. If the substring is a palindrome, it adds the substring to the current partition `path`, recursively calls itself with the remaining substring `s[i:]`, and then removes the last added substring from the partition to explore other possibilities.

4. After exploring all possibilities for the current substring, the method removes the last added substring from the partition to backtrack and try other combinations.

This approach ensures

```


To solve the problem of removing an invalid node and all nodes underneath it, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree and identify the invalid node. Here's the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def correctBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        seen = set()
        
        def dfs(node, parent):
            if not node:
                return
            if node.right in seen:
                parent.right = None
                return
            seen.add(node)
            dfs(node.left, node)
            dfs(node.right, node)
        
        dfs(root, None)
        return root
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of nodes that have already been visited during the DFS traversal.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - We define a helper function `dfs` that takes a node and its parent as arguments.
   - If the current node is `None`, we return immediately.
   - If the right child of the current node (`node.right`) is already in the `seen` set, it means we have found the invalid node. We set the right child of the parent to `None` to remove the invalid node and all nodes underneath it.
   - If the current node is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and recursively call `dfs` for the left and right children of the current node.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After performing the DFS traversal, we return the root of the modified tree.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and remove the invalid node and all nodes underneath it. The use of a set helps in efficiently checking for the presence of the right child of the current node in the `seen` set. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and the space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the

        return len(distinct_subarrays)
```
This solution works as follows:

1. We define a helper function `is_divisible_by_p` to check if a number is divisible by `p`.

2. We initialize a set `distinct_subarrays` to store unique subarrays.

3. We iterate over all possible starting indices of subarrays.

4. For each starting index, we initialize a counter `divisible_count` to keep track of how many numbers in the subarray are divisible by `p`.

5. We iterate over all possible ending indices of subarrays starting from the current starting index.

6. For each ending index, we check if the number at that index is divisible by `p`. If it is, we increment the `divisible_count`.

7. If the `divisible_count` exceeds `k`, we break out of the loop because no more subarrays can satisfy the condition.

8. If the `divisible_count` is less than or equal to `k`, we convert the subarray to a tuple and add it to the `distinct_subarrays` set.

9. Finally, we return the size of the `distinct_subarrays` set, which represents the number of distinct subarrays that satisfy the conditions. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. However, it correctly counts the number of distinct subarrays that satisfy the conditions. If you need a solution with a lower time complexity, please let me know!

        # Iterate through each number in the array
        for num in nums:
            # Create a copy of the dp table to avoid modifying it
            new_dp = dp[:]
            
            # Update the dp table
            for j in range(total_sum, num - 1, -1):
                new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + dp[j - num]) % MOD
            
            # Copy the updated dp table to the original dp table
            dp = new_dp
        
        # The number of distinct great partitions is the sum of all possible partitions
        # except for the partition where both groups have the same sum
        return (dp[total_sum] - 1) % MOD
```
This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort the Array**: We sort the array in descending order to maximize the difference between the two groups.

2. **Calculate Total Sum**: We calculate the total sum of the array.

3. **Check Feasibility**: If the total sum is less than `2*k`, it's impossible to partition the array into two groups such that each group has a sum greater than or equal to `k`, so we return 0.

4. **Initialize DP Table**: We initialize a DP table `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to partition the array such that the sum of one group is `j`.

5. **Iterate Through Each Number**: For each number in the array, we create a copy of the DP table to avoid modifying it during the update process. We then update the DP table by adding the number of ways to partition the array such that the sum of
ref:
def countPartitions(nums, k):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    n = len(nums)
    mod = 1000000007

    if total_sum < k * 2:
        return 0

    dp = [1] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(1, k):
        for j in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            dp[j] = (dp[j] * j + dp[j - 1]) % mod

    result = 0

    for i in range(n - 1):
        total_sum -= nums[i]
        if total_sum >= k:
            result = (result + dp[i + 1]) % mod

    return result

```

This solution uses a stack to keep track of characters. When a star is encountered, it checks if the stack is not empty and pops the last character. If a character is not a star, it is pushed onto the stack. Finally, the stack is joined into a string and returned. This approach ensures that all stars are removed correctly while maintaining the relative order of non-star characters. ``` ``` ```python

        weekdays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
        return weekdays[weekday_index]
```

This solution uses Python's built-in `datetime` module to create a `datetime` object for the given date. It then retrieves the weekday as an integer using the `weekday()` method, which returns an integer representing the weekday (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc.). Finally, it maps this integer to the corresponding day name using a list of strings and returns the result. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's powerful date handling capabilities. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

```


This solution works as follows:

1. We use a counter to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

2. We initialize an empty stack to simulate the robot's actions and an empty list `res` to store the resulting string.

3. We iterate through each character in the string `s`:
   - We push the current character onto the stack.
   - We decrement the count of the current character in the counter.

4. After pushing the current character onto the stack, we check if the last element in the stack is the smallest remaining character. This is done by comparing the last element with the smallest remaining character in the counter.

5. If the last element in the stack is the smallest remaining character, we pop it from the stack and append it to the result list `res`.

6. Finally, we return the result list `res` as a string.

This approach ensures that we always pick the smallest remaining character when possible, leading to the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the stack and counter. ```python
```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def robotWithString(self, s: str) -> str:
        count = Counter(s)
        stack = []

            if nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
                # Calculate the gap needed to make the current number unique
                gap = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1
                # Add the gap to the result counter
                result += gap
                # Update the current number to the next unique number
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1
        
        return result
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort the Array**: We start by sorting the array. Sorting helps in easily finding the smallest gap between consecutive numbers.

2. **Initialize Result Counter**: We initialize a result counter to keep track of the total number of increments needed.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element.

4. **Check for Consecutive Numbers**: For each element, we check if it is less than or equal to the previous element. This indicates that the current element is not unique.

5. **Calculate Gap**: If the current element is not unique, we calculate the gap needed to make it unique. The gap is the difference between the previous element and the current element plus one (since we need to increment the current element to make it greater than the previous one).

6. **Update Result and Current Element**: We add the gap to the result counter and update the current element to the next unique number by adding the calculated gap.

7. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total number of increments needed.

This approach ensures that we efficiently make all numbers in the array unique with the minimum number of increments. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) if we ignore the space required for sorting. However, if sorting is not allowed, we can achieve the same result in

*** Leetcode Example Question 5 ***
Given a binary tree, return the **inorder traversal** of its nodes' values.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,null,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
**Code solution:**

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to perform the inorder traversal of the binary tree. The algorithm defines a helper function `dfs` that recursively traverses the left subtree, visits the current node, and then traverses the right subtree.

The `dfs` function checks if the current node is `null`. If it is, the function returns immediately. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself for the left child, appends the value of the current node to the result list, and then recursively calls itself for the right child.

The `inorderTraversal` function initializes an empty list `result` to store the inorder traversal of the tree. It then

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the connected component containing the specified cell `(row, col)`. During the DFS traversal, it marks all cells of the component with a negative value of the original color to indicate that they belong to the component.

After the DFS traversal, the algorithm checks each cell in the grid. If a cell has a negative value of the original color, it means it belongs to the component, and its color is changed to the specified `color`. If a cell has a negative value of twice the original color, it means it was visited during the DFS traversal but is not part of the component, and its color is restored to the original color. Finally, the modified grid is returned. This approach ensures that only the border of the connected component is colored, and the rest of the component remains unchanged.

```


This solution works as follows:

1. We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.

2. We initialize an empty string `result` to store the final reordered string.

3. We enter a loop that continues until all characters have been processed.

4. Inside the loop, we first append the smallest characters to the result string. We do this by iterating over the sorted keys of the `char_count` dictionary and appending each character to the result string as long as its count is greater than zero.

5. After appending the smallest characters, we append the largest characters to the result string. We do this by iterating over the sorted keys of the `char_count` dictionary in reverse order and appending each character to the result string as long as its count is greater than zero.

6. We repeat steps 4 and 5 until all characters have been processed.

7. Finally, we return the `result` string. Note that if a character appears more than once, it will be appended to the result string multiple times according to its count. However, the problem guarantees that the input string will always contain at least one character, so the loop will always terminate. ```python
```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def sortString(self, s: str) -> str:
        result = ""
        char_count = Counter(s)

This solution works as follows:

1. We use a dictionary `anagram_groups` to store lists of words that are anagrams of each other. The key is the sorted version of the word, which acts as a unique identifier for each anagram group.

2. We iterate over each word in the input list `words`. For each word, we sort its characters to get the anagram key. We then append the word to the list corresponding to this anagram key in the dictionary.

3. After processing all words, we filter out the groups that contain more than one word. These groups represent anagrams that cannot be removed according to the problem statement.

4. Finally, we return the list of words that are not part of any anagram group with more than one word. These words are the result of removing all anagrams from the input list. ``` ``` ```python

    The algorithm converts each integer in the input list `nums` to a string. Then, it sorts the list of strings using a custom comparison function `compare` defined in the `cmp_to_key` function. The `compare` function takes two strings `x` and `y` and returns the result of comparing the concatenated strings `y + x` and `x + y`. This ensures that the largest number is formed when concatenating the strings in the sorted order.

Finally, the algorithm joins the sorted list of strings into a single string and returns it. If the resulting string starts with '0', it means that all numbers in the input list are zeros, and the algorithm returns '0'. Otherwise, it returns the resulting string.

This solution uses a recursive approach to delete the node with the given key. It handles three cases:
1. The node to be deleted has no children.
2. The node to be deleted has one child.
3. The node to be deleted has two children. In this case, it finds the inorder successor (the smallest node in the right subtree) and copies its value to the node to be deleted, then deletes the inorder successor. This ensures that the BST property is maintained. **Note**: The follow-up constraint is not strictly met here, as the solution is already O(height of tree) due to the recursive nature of the search and deletion process. However, the solution is still efficient for balanced trees. **Follow-up**: If the tree is unbalanced, consider using an iterative approach with a stack to maintain the height of the tree, achieving O(height of tree) time complexity. But for balanced trees, the recursive solution is more straightforward and easier to understand. **Please note**: The provided solution assumes that the tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). If the tree is not a BST, additional checks would be needed to ensure the correct deletion. **Follow-up**: If the tree is unbalanced, consider using an iterative approach with a stack to maintain the height of the tree, achieving O(height of tree) time complexity.

```
This solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time. The `dp` table is initialized with infinity values, and the base case is set for the first road. The DP table is filled iteratively, considering both the current road and the previous roads with different numbers of skips. Finally, the minimum number of skips required is found by checking if the time taken to complete all roads is less than or equal to `hoursBefore`. If no valid solution is found, `-1` is returned. **End of solution**

```
This solution uses a dictionary to store the points and their counts. The `add` method simply increments the count for the given point. The `count` method iterates over all the points and checks if they form an axis-aligned square with the given point. If they do, it multiplies the counts of the points and adds them to the total count. Note that duplicate points are allowed and treated as different points. The time complexity of the `add` method is O(1) and the time complexity of the `count` method is O(n), where n is the number of points stored in the dictionary. The space complexity of the solution is O(n). Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification! ```python

This solution works as follows:

1. **Build the Adjacency List**: We create an adjacency list to represent the graph.

2. **Find Connected Components**: We use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find all connected components in the graph. Each component is stored in a set.

3. **Count Infected Nodes**: We define a function `count_infected_nodes` to count the number of infected nodes in a given component among the initial nodes.

4. **Find Maximum Infected Nodes**: We iterate over the initial nodes and find the maximum number of infected nodes among them.

5. **Find the Node with Maximum Infected Nodes**: We iterate over the initial nodes again and find the node with the maximum number of infected nodes. If there are multiple nodes with the same maximum number of infected nodes, we choose the one with the smallest index.

Both solutions are correct and efficient. They iterate through the string once, checking each group of three consecutive characters to see if they are the same and valid for removal. If they are, they increment the respective move counter for Alice or Bob. Finally, they compare the move counters and return `True` if Alice has more moves than Bob, indicating that Alice wins. Otherwise, they return `False`. The second solution is slightly more concise and easier to understand, while the first solution is more verbose but also more efficient. Choose the one that best fits your coding style and preference. ```python

```

This solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to explore all possible combinations of the lock. It maintains a queue of tuples containing the current combination and the number of steps taken to reach it. The `visited` set keeps track of combinations that have already been processed to avoid redundant calculations. The `directions` list defines the possible movements for each digit of the lock. The algorithm continues until it finds the target combination or exhausts all possibilities. If the target combination is not reachable, it returns -1. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(10^4 * 4 * 8) = O(40000) because there are 10^4 possible combinations (4 digits, each with 10 possible values),

This solution iterates through each character in the string `s`. It maintains a `current_depth` variable to track the current level of nesting and a `max_depth` variable to store the maximum depth encountered. Whenever it encounters an opening parenthesis `(`, it increments the `current_depth` and updates the `max_depth` if the `current_depth` exceeds the current `max_depth`. When it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, it decrements the `current_depth`. Finally, it returns the `max_depth`. This ensures that the algorithm correctly calculates the nesting depth of the VPS represented by the string `s`.

This solution works as follows:

1. **Build Adjacency List**: We create an adjacency list to represent the graph using an undirected edge.

2. **Calculate Degree**: We calculate the degree of each node by counting the number of edges connected to it.

3. **Sort Degrees**: We sort the degrees in ascending order.

4. **Initialize Result List**: We initialize a result list to store the number of pairs for each query.

5. **Use Prefix Sum**: We use a prefix sum array to count the number of pairs with a specific degree sum. For each degree `d`, we count how many pairs `(a, b)` exist such that `degree[a] + degree[b] > d`.

6. **Find Pairs**: For each query, we use binary search to find the smallest and largest degrees that satisfy the condition `degree[a] +

This solution works as follows:

1. **Height Calculation**: The `height` function calculates the height of the tree. It returns the maximum height of the left and right subtrees plus one for the current node.

2. **LCA Calculation**: The `lca` function finds the LCA of the deepest leaves. It checks if the current node is a leaf and if its height matches the maximum height. If so, it returns the current node as the LCA. If not, it recursively finds the LCA in the left and right subtrees. If both left and right LCA are not `None`, the current node is the LCA. Otherwise, it returns the LCA found in either the left or right subtree.

3. **Finding Maximum Height**: The `max_height` variable stores the maximum height of the tree, which is used to identify the deepest leaves.

4. **Finding LCA**: Finally, the ` 47%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹     | 14/30 [03:15<03:43, 14.00s/it]

```

This solution uses a `SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` library to maintain the elements of the sliding window in sorted order. The `SortedList` allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations, making it suitable for maintaining the window of size `k`.

The algorithm iterates over the input array `nums`, adding each new element to the `SortedList`. If the window size exceeds `k`, the oldest element is removed from the `SortedList`.

When the window size reaches `k`, the median is calculated. If the number of elements in the `SortedList` is odd, the median is the middle element. If the number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

The calculated median is appended to the `medians` list, which is returned at the end. This approach ensures that the median is calculated efficiently for each window position. Note that the `SortedList` provides the necessary operations to maintain the window and calculate the median. **END**

This solution uses a prefix sum approach to efficiently count the number of subarrays with a sum equal to the goal. It maintains a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` to keep track of the frequency of each prefix sum encountered. As it iterates through the array, it updates the prefix sum and checks if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals the goal. If such a prefix sum exists, it adds the count of that prefix sum to the result. Finally, it updates the dictionary with the current prefix sum and increments its count. This approach ensures that the solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array. ``` ``` ```python

        return count_xor_pairs(nums, low, high)
```

This solution uses a precomputed table to store the XOR counts for all possible XOR values. The `count_xor_pairs` function then iterates over the array and for each element, it calculates the number of pairs with XOR values in the range `[low, high]`. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * 16), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(2^16) due to the precomputed table. This approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints.

**Code solution:** 
 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxIceCream(self, costs: List[int], coins: int) -> int:
        # Count the occurrences of each cost
        count = {}
        for cost in costs:
            if cost in count:
                count[cost] += 1
            else:
                count[cost] = 1
        
        # Sort the costs in ascending order
        sorted_costs = sorted(count.keys())
        
        # Try to buy as many ice cream bars as possible
        ice_cream_bars = 0
        for cost in sorted_costs:
            if coins >= cost:
                ice_cream_bars += min(count[cost], coins // cost)
                coins -= count[cost] * cost
            else:
                break
        
        return ice_cream_bars
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Count Occurrences**: We first count the occurrences of each cost using a dictionary `count`.

2. **Sort Costs**: We then sort the unique costs in ascending order.

3. **Buy Ice Cream Bars**: We iterate over the sorted costs. For each cost, we try to buy as many ice cream bars as possible with the remaining coins. We update the number of ice cream bars bought and the remaining coins accordingly.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total number of ice cream bars bought.

This approach ensures that we buy as many ice cream bars as possible with the given coins, by always choosing the cheapest available ice cream bar first. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of unique costs. The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the counts. Note that the problem constraints allow us to use this approach efficiently.

**Explanation:**

1. **Graph Construction**: We construct an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.

2. **Initialization**: We initialize a result list to store the sum of distances for each node and a visited list to keep track of nodes that have already been processed.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Counting Nodes**:
   - We define a helper function `dfs` that performs a DFS to count the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node.
   - For each node, we mark it as visited and initialize its result to 1 (since the node itself is a single node).
   - We then iterate through its neighbors. For each neighbor, if it is not the parent of the current node, we recursively count the nodes in the subtree rooted at the neighbor.
   - We update the result for the current node by adding the number of nodes in its subtree and the result of its neighbor.
   - Finally, we return the result for the current node.

This implementation uses a Trie data structure to store the words. The `addWord` method inserts each word into the Trie, and the `search` method checks if a word exists in the Trie using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. If the word contains a dot (`.`), the search method checks all possible paths in the Trie that match the remaining characters. The `dfs` function returns `True` if a matching word is found, otherwise it returns `False`. This solution handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement. ```python

```

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. For each node, it calculates the height of its left and right subtrees. If either subtree is unbalanced (returns -1), or the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, the current node is unbalanced, and the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the maximum height of the left and right subtrees plus 1.

The `isBalanced` function initializes the DFS process by calling `dfs(root)`. If the result of the DFS is not -1, it means the tree is balanced, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

This solution uses a hash map to keep track of the prefix sums encountered so far. It iterates through the linked list, updating the prefix sum at each node. If the current prefix sum has been seen before, it means there is a subarray with a sum of zero, and it removes that subarray by adjusting the pointers in the linked list. The algorithm ensures that only one subarray with a sum of zero is removed at a time, and it handles all cases correctly according to the problem constraints. The final result is the head of the modified linked list. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the `start` and `target` strings, respectively.

2. While both pointers are within the bounds of the strings, move `i` to the next 'L' or '_' character and `j` to the next 'R' or '_' character.

3. If both `i` and `j` are at the same position, check if the characters at those positions are the same. If not, return `False`.

4. If the characters are 'L', check if `j` is less than `i`. If so, return `False` because an 'L' should not appear after an 'R'.

5. If the characters are 'R', check if `j` is greater than `i`. If so, return `False` because an 'R' should not appear before an 'L'.

6. Move both pointers `i` and `j` to the next positions.

7. After the loop, check if all 'L' and '

This solution converts the prices from strings to floats, calculates the sum of the original prices, and checks if it is less than the target. If it is, it returns -1. It then calculates the maximum and minimum possible sums of the rounded prices and checks if they are less than or greater than the target. If they are, it returns -1. Finally, it calculates the minimum rounding error by trying all possible combinations of floor and ceil operations and returning the one with the smallest error. The

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to `k`, which is the center of the subarray.
2. Initialize `res` with the value of `nums[k]` because the smallest element in the subarray starting at `k` is `nums[k]` itself.
3. Initialize `min_val` with the value of `nums[k]`.
4. Expand the window to the left by decrementing `left` and updating `min_val` if the new left element is smaller than `min_val`.
5. Update `res` with the maximum value of the current subarray.
6. Expand the window to the right by incrementing `right` and updating `min_val` if the new right element is smaller than `min_val`.
7. Update `res` with the maximum value of the current subarray.
8. Return `res` as the maximum possible score of a good subarray. ``` ``` ```python

```


This solution works by reversing the linked list, performing the addition, and then reversing it back to its original order. The `reverse_linked_list` function is used to reverse the linked list, making it easier to process the digits from least significant to most significant. The `plusOne` function handles the addition of one to the number represented by the linked list. Finally, the reversed linked list is returned as the result. This approach ensures that the solution handles cases where the carry over exceeds the number of digits in the linked list. The constraints are met as the function correctly processes the linked list and handles all edge cases.

            return 0
        
        # Return the length of the unsorted subarray
        return end - start + 1
```


This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, to -1. These will store the indices of the first and last elements of the unsorted subarray, respectively.

2. Traverse the array from left to right and keep track of the maximum value encountered so far. If the current element is less than the maximum value, it means the current element is out of order, and we update the `end` pointer.

3. Traverse the array from right to left and keep track of the minimum value encountered so far. If the current element is greater than the minimum value, it means the current element is out of order, and we update the `start` pointer.

4. If both `start` and `end` pointers remain -1, it means the array is already sorted, and we return 0.

5. Otherwise, we return the length of the unsorted subarray by subtracting `start` from `end` and adding 1.

This solution runs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. It finds the first and last elements that are out of order and returns the length of the unsorted subarray. This approach ensures that we only traverse the array twice, making it efficient. Note that this solution assumes that the array contains unique elements 57%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹    | 17/30 [03:57<03:01, 13.96s/it]

**Code solution:**

from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def rankTeams(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:
        if not votes or not votes[0]:
            return ""

        sorted_teams = sorted(rank.keys(), key=lambda x: (rank[x], x))
        
        return "".join(sorted_teams)
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a dictionary `rank` where each key is a team name and the value is a list of integers representing the team's rank at each position.

2. **Initial Rank Setup**: We create a list of tuples for each team with their initial ranks set to zero.

3. **Counting Votes**: We iterate over each vote and decrement the rank of the corresponding team at each position.

4. **Sorting Teams**: We sort the teams by their ranks. If two teams have the same rank, we sort them alphabetically by their team name.

5. **Result Construction**: Finally, we join the sorted team names into a single string and return it. This string represents the teams sorted according to the specified ranking system.

def rankTeams(votes):
    n, m = len(votes), len(votes[0])

        for j, team in enumerate(vote):
            count[ord(team) - ord('A')][j] += 1

    return ''.join(sorted(res, key=lambda x: (-count[ord(x) - ord('A')][:m], x)))

This solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree level by level. It uses a queue to store the nodes at each level and processes them one by one.

This Python solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path in the binary matrix. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize the number of rows (`n`) and check if the starting or ending cell is blocked (`grid[0][0] == 1` or `grid[n-1][n-1] == 1`). If either is true, we return `-1` because there's no clear path.
   - We define the possible movement directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
   - We use a queue to perform BFS and a set to keep track of visited cells.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - We start the BFS from the top-left cell `(0, 0)`.
   - For each level of BFS, we process all cells at that level.
   - We increment the step count after processing all cells at the current level.

        stack = []

```    
    
    This solution works by using a stack to keep track of the nodes in the linked list. It starts by pushing all the nodes onto the stack until it reaches the end of the list. Then, it pops the nodes from the stack one by one and prints their values in reverse order. This ensures that the nodes are printed in the correct order, even though the original linked list is immutable. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is also O(n) because we are using a stack to store the nodes. However, this solution does not meet the requirements of the follow-up questions, which ask for constant space complexity and linear time complexity with less than linear space complexity.

```
    
    This solution uses an in-order traversal of the BST to find the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes. The `inorder` function traverses the tree in ascending order and keeps track of the previous node's value (`self.prev`) and the minimum difference (`self.min_diff`). During each traversal, it calculates the difference between the current node's value and the previous node's value, and updates `self.min_diff` if the calculated difference is smaller than the current `self.min_diff`. Finally, it returns `self.min_diff` after the traversal is complete. **Code solution:**

            res %= mod
        return res
```


### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `res` to store the total number of homogenous substrings and `mod` to 10^9 + 7, which is used to handle large numbers.

2. **Iterate through the string**: We iterate through the string using a for loop. For each character, we initialize `count` to 1, which represents the length of the current homogenous substring starting at the current character.

3. **Count consecutive characters**: We use a while loop to count the number of consecutive characters that are the same as the current character. We increment `count` and move the pointer `i` forward until we encounter a different character.

4. **Calculate the number of homogenous substrings**: For each homogenous substring of length `count`, the number of possible substrings is given by the formula `(count * (count + 1)) // 2`. We add this to `res` and take the result modulo `mod` to prevent overflow.

5. **Return the result**: After iterating through the entire string, we return the value of `res`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count all homogenous substrings in the string, even for large inputs, by leveraging the properties of arithmetic sequences. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(1).

This solution first checks if the sum of the `colsum` array equals the sum of `upper` and `lower`. If not, it returns an empty list since a valid matrix cannot be constructed.

Then, it initializes a 2D list `result` with zeros, where each sublist represents a row of the matrix.

Next, it iterates through each element in `colsum`:
- If the element is 2, it sets both corresponding elements in the 0th and 1st rows to 1 and decrements `upper` and `lower`.
- If the element is 1, it sets the corresponding element in the row with the smaller `upper` or `lower` value to 1 and decrements that value.

Finally, it checks if `upper` and `lower` are still zero. If not, it returns an empty list since the matrix cannot be constructed. Otherwise, it returns the constructed matrix.

This solution uses a backtracking approach to generate all possible word squares. The `candidates` dictionary is used to store all words that start with a given prefix, which allows us to efficiently find valid next words in the word square. The `backtrack` function recursively builds the word square by appending valid words to the current path and exploring all possible extensions. If the path reaches the desired length, it is added to the result list. The function is called with each word in the input list as the starting point for generating word squares. The final result list contains all valid word squares generated from the input words.

This solution uses a binary search approach to find the minimized largest sum of the split. The `is_valid` function checks if it's possible to split the array into at most `k` subarrays with a maximum sum of `mid`. The binary search narrows down the possible values for the largest sum until it finds the smallest value that satisfies the condition. ``` ``` ```python

This solution works as follows:

1. **Count Request Occurrences**: We use a `Counter` to keep track of how many times each index in `nums` is requested.

2. **Calculate Prefix Sum**: We create a prefix sum array to store the cumulative count of requests up to each index. This helps us determine how many times each index is requested.

3. **Sort Arrays**: We sort `nums` in descending order and the `request_counts` items in descending order based on the count of requests.

4. **Calculate Maximum Sum**: We iterate over the sorted arrays, multiplying each number by its corresponding request count and summing the results. We take the modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure the result fits within the required limits.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the maximum sum of range queries by leveraging sorting and prefix sums. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n), where n is the length of `nums`. The space complexity is O(n) for

``` 

This solution iterates over all indices in the `words` array and calculates the distance from the `startIndex` to each index. It then checks both directions (from `startIndex` to `i` and from `i` to `startIndex`) and updates the `min_distance` accordingly. If the `min_distance` remains infinity, it means the target was not found in the array, and the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the shortest distance found.

This solution works by iterating over possible bases `k` from `max_k` down to `2`. For each base `k`, it calculates the size of the base `k` representation and checks if the sum of a geometric series equals `n`. If a match is found, it returns the base `k` as the smallest good base. If no match is found, it returns the largest base `2` as the default answer. Note that this solution assumes that `n` is always greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^{18}\).

This solution uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the target in the matrix. By treating the matrix as a flattened list, we can perform a binary search on the entire matrix in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity. The `left` and `right` pointers are used to keep track of the search range, and the middle index is calculated using integer division to ensure the correct row and column indices. If the middle value matches the target, the function returns `True`. If the middle value is less than the target, the search continues in the right half of the matrix; otherwise, it continues in the left half. If the search range is exhausted without finding the target, the function returns `False`. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. Happy coding! :)

It takes three parameters: `start`, which is the current index in the candidates list, `path`, which is the current combination being built, and `target`, which is the remaining target value.

If the `target` becomes zero, it means a valid combination has been found, so it is added to the `result` list. If the `target` becomes negative, it means the current combination is invalid, so the function returns without further exploration.

The `backtrack` function iterates through the candidates list starting from the `start` index. For each candidate, it adds the candidate to the `path` and recursively calls itself with the updated `start`, `path`, and `target`. After the recursive call, it removes the last element from the `path` to explore other possibilities.

The `result` list is returned after all combinations have been explored. This solution ensures that all unique combinations are found and returned in any order.    

ref:
def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def findCombinations(startIndex, remaining):
        if remaining == 0:
            return [[]]
        if startIndex == len(candidates) or remaining < 0:
            return []

        result = []
        result.extend(findCombinations(startIndex + 1, remaining))
        result.extend([x + [candidates[startIndex]] for x in findCombinations(startIndex, remaining - candidates[startIndex])])
        
        return result

    return findCombinations(0, target)

            num_rooms = max(num_rooms, len(end_times))
        
        return num_rooms
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort Intervals**: The intervals are sorted by their start times. This ensures that we process meetings in chronological order.

2. **Min-Heap for End Times**: We use a min-heap to keep track of the end times of the meetings currently being held. This allows us to efficiently determine if a new meeting can start immediately after the last meeting ends.

3. **Iterate Over Intervals**: For each interval, we check if it can start immediately after the last meeting ends:
   - If it can, we push its end time onto the heap.
   - If it cannot, we pop the earliest end time from the heap and push the current meeting's end time onto the heap.

4. **Update Number of Rooms**: After processing each interval, we update the number of rooms needed by taking the maximum size of the heap.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the number of rooms needed, which represents the minimum number of rooms required to hold all meetings. 

This approach ensures that we always use the fewest number of rooms possible while processing the meetings in order. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the end times

3. **Count Subtrees Function**: The `count_subtrees_with_diameter` function counts the number of subtrees with a given diameter `d`. It generates all possible subsets of nodes using bit manipulation. For each subset, it checks if the subset forms a valid subtree

This solution calculates the prefix sums of the matrix to efficiently compute the block sums. The prefix sum matrix helps in quickly finding the sum of any submatrix by subtracting appropriate overlapping submatrix sums. The final result matrix contains the sum of elements for each block defined by the given constraints. 

The time complexity is O(m * n) due to the prefix sum calculation, and the space complexity is also O(m * n) for storing the prefix sums and the result matrix. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient even for larger matrices and values of `k`.

```
    
    The algorithm starts by initializing two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the `seats` array respectively. It also initializes a variable `max_dist` to store the maximum distance to the closest person.

The algorithm first finds the leftmost occupied seat by iterating through the `seats` array from the beginning until it encounters an occupied seat. Similarly, it finds the rightmost occupied seat by iterating through the `seats` array from the end until it encounters an occupied seat.

Next, the algorithm calculates the maximum distance to the closest person by taking the maximum of the distance from the leftmost occupied seat to the start of the array, the distance from the rightmost occupied seat to the end of the array, and the distance between the two occupied seats divided by 2 (since the person sitting in the middle of the two occupied seats will be equidistant from both).

Finally, the algorithm returns the `max_dist` variable, which contains the maximum distance to the closest person.

                left = mid + 1
        
        return left
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We define a helper function `can_distribute(max_products)` that checks if it's possible to distribute the products to the stores such that no store gets more than `max_products` products.

2. We initialize `left` to 1 and `right` to the maximum value in `quantities` because the minimum possible maximum number of products is 1, and the maximum possible is the maximum quantity in `quantities`.

3. We use a binary search to find the minimum possible maximum number of products. In each iteration, we calculate the middle value `mid` and check if it's possible to distribute the products using the `can_distribute` function.

4. If it's possible, we move the `right` pointer to `mid` because we are looking for a smaller maximum number of products. Otherwise, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.

5. The binary search terminates when `left` equals `right`, and `left` is the minimum possible maximum number of products.

This solution has a time complexity of O(m log M), where m is the length of `quantities` and M is the maximum value in `quantities`. The space complexity is O(1). Note that we use the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to perform the binary search efficiently. However, we can also implement the binary search manually without using the `bisect_left` function. Here's an alternative implementation:

```python

    remaining_stores = n

        remaining_stores -= (q + x - 1) // x
        if remaining_stores < 0:
            x = (sum_products + remaining_stores) // (n + remaining_stores)
            remaining_stores = n

```
This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort Courses**: The courses are sorted by their last day in ascending order. This ensures that we consider courses with earlier deadlines first, which helps in maximizing the number of courses that can be taken.

2. **Use Min-Heap**: A min-heap is used to keep track of the durations of the courses that are currently being taken. This allows us to easily find and remove the longest course if adding a new course would exceed the last day.

3. **Iterate Through Courses**: For each course, we add its duration to the total duration. If adding the current course would exceed the last day, we remove the longest course from the heap and subtract its duration from the total duration. This ensures that we always have enough space to take the current course without exceeding the last day.

4. **Push Duration onto Heap**: We push the negative duration of the current course onto the heap. This is because Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, so we use negative values to simulate a max-heap.

5. **Return Result**: The size of the heap at the end of the iteration represents the maximum number of courses that can be taken.

This approach ensures that we always take the courses that will allow us to maximize the number of courses taken within the given constraints. The

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Graph Construction**: We first build an adjacency list representation of the graph using the `richer` array. Each node `v` has a list of neighbors `u` such that `u` is richer than `v`.

2. **Initialization**: We initialize a result array `result` where each element is the index of the person. This array will store the least quiet person in the subtree rooted at each node.

3. **DFS Function**: We define a DFS function that performs the following tasks:
   - For each neighbor of the current node, we recursively call the DFS function.
   - After visiting all neighbors, we compare the quietness of the current node's least quiet person (`result[node]`) with the quietness of the least quiet person of its neighbors (`result[neighbor]`).
   - If the quietness of the current node's least quiet person is greater than the quietness of the neighbor's least quiet person, we update the current node's least quiet person to the neighbor's least quiet person.

4. **Starting DFS**: We start the DFS from each node in the graph. This ensures that we consider all possible paths in the graph and find the least quiet person in each subtree.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the result array, which contains the least quiet person for each node in the graph. This

        res = [0] * n
        for start, end, seats in bookings:

            if end < n:

        for i in range(1, n):
            res[i] += res[i - 1]
        return res
``` 
This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize a result array `res` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. This array will store the cumulative number of seats reserved for each flight.

2. We iterate through each booking in the `bookings` list. For each booking, we increment the count of seats reserved for the flight starting at `start - 1` by `seats`. If the booking ends at a flight later than `n`, we decrement the count of seats reserved for the flight at index `end` by `seats`. This is because the seats are only reserved for flights in the range `[start, end]`, and we need to subtract the seats reserved for flights after `end` from the count.

3. After processing all bookings, we iterate through the `res` array and update each element to be the sum of itself and the previous element. This is because the cumulative number of seats reserved for each flight is the sum of the seats reserved for all flights up to that point.

4. Finally, we return the `res` array as the result. This array contains the total number of seats reserved for each flight. ``` ``` ```python

        # Sort the array in ascending order
        nums.sort()
        
        # Calculate the maximum product of three numbers
        n = len(nums)
        max_product = max(nums[n-1]*nums[n-2]*nums[n-3], nums[0]*nums[1]*nums[n-1])
        
        return max_product
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort the Array**: The input array `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps in easily accessing the smallest and largest numbers in the array.

2. **Calculate Maximum Product**: 
   - The maximum product can be either obtained by multiplying the three largest numbers (`nums[n-1]`, `nums[n-2]`, `nums[n-3]`) or by multiplying the two smallest numbers (`nums[0]`, `nums[1]`) with the largest number (`nums[n-1]`).
   - We calculate both possibilities and return the maximum of these two products.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of three numbers to find the maximum product efficiently. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

                result.append(i)
        
        return result
```


This solution works as follows:

1. **Counter Initialization**: We initialize a `Counter` for the `words` list to keep track of the frequency of each word.

2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `word_length` is the length of each word in the `words` list.
   - `total_length` is the total length of the concatenated substring, which is `word_length * len(words)`.

3. **Result Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to store the starting indices of the concatenated substrings.

4. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - We iterate over the string `s` using a sliding window of size `total_length`.
   - For each window, we extract substrings of length `word_length` and use a `Counter` to count the frequency of each word in the current window.

5. **Comparison and Result Collection**:
   - If the `Counter` of the current window matches the `word_count`, it means the current window is a concatenated substring, and we append the starting index `i` to the `result` list.

6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the list of starting indices of all concatenated substrings.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find all concatenated substrings by leveraging the `Counter` for quick comparisons and the sliding window technique to handle the constraints. The time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the length of the string `s` and m is the length of each word in the `words` list. The space complexity is O(m) for storing the `word_count` and the `window_counter`.

        return pow(2, group_count, 10**9 + 7)
``` 
This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort the Ranges**: We sort the ranges based on their start values. This allows us to easily determine if a range overlaps with the previous one.

2. **Initialize Variables**: We initialize `last_end` to track the end value of the last group formed and `group_count` to count the number of groups.

3. **Iterate Through Ranges**: For each range, we check if it starts after the `last_end` value. If it does, it forms a new group, so we increment `group_count` and update `last_end` to the end value of the current range.

4. **Calculate the Result**: The total number of ways to split the ranges into two groups is equivalent to choosing a group for each range. Since each range can independently be in either group, we use `pow(2, group_count, 10**9 + 7)` to calculate the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This handles the large number of possible combinations efficiently.

        return dfs(0, k)
```


This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization (`@lru_cache`) to solve the problem. The `dfs` function takes two parameters: `i`, the current index of the event being considered, and `k`, the number of opportunities left to attend events. The function returns the maximum value that can be obtained by attending events up to the `i`-th event with `k` opportunities.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `i` is out of bounds (i.e., `i >= len(events)`), or if `k` is zero, return 0 because no more events can be attended.

2. **Skip the Current Event**:
   - Calculate the maximum value obtained by skipping the current event and moving to the next event (`i + 1`).

3. **Attend the Current Event**:
   - Find the next event that doesn't overlap with the current event using binary search (`bisect_right`). This ensures that the current event and the next event don't overlap.
   - Calculate the maximum value obtained by attending the current event and recursively calling `dfs` for the next event with `k - 1` opportunities.

4. **Return the Maximum Value**:
   - Return the maximum value obtained by either skipping or attending the current event.

5. **Sort Events**:
   - Sort the events by their start day to facilitate the binary search for

        if duration > max_duration or (duration == max_duration and keysPressed[i] > max_key):
            max_key = keysPressed[i]
            max_duration = duration
    return max_key

        return count
```


**Explanation:**


1. **countBits Function**: This helper function counts the number of '1's in a binary string, which represents the number of unique letters in the string.

2. **generateSubsets Function**: This helper function generates all possible subsets of the given string by removing one '1' at a time. It sorts each subset to ensure that they are in lexicographical order.

3. **match Function**: This function checks if a target word can be formed by removing one letter from a start word. It generates all subsets of the start word and checks if any of them have one less '1' than the target word.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - We create a set of bit counts for all start words to quickly check if a target word can be formed.
   - We iterate through each target word and use the `match` function to determine if it can be formed by removing one letter from a start word.
   - We count the number of target words that can be formed and return the result.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check each target word against the start words using bit manipulation and subset generation, making it suitable for large inputs. **Time Complexity**: O(n * m * log(m)), where n is the number of start words, m is the average length of the words, and log(m) comes from sorting the subsets. **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of start words, due to storing the bit counts in a set.

    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Dictionary to store anagrams grouped by their sorted key
        anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Iterate over each string in the input list

        # Return the values of the dictionary, which are lists of grouped anagrams
        return list(anagram_groups.values())
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We use a `defaultdict` to store groups of anagrams. The key for each group is a sorted version of the characters in the anagrams. This allows us to easily identify anagrams that have the same characters in a different order.

2. We iterate over each string in the input list `strs`.

3. For each string, we sort its characters to create a unique key for the anagram group. This ensures that all anagrams with the same characters will have the same key.

4. We append the string to the list of anagrams corresponding to its sorted key. This is done using the `defaultdict`'s default factory, which initializes a new list for each new key.

5. Finally, we return the values of the `defaultdict`, which are lists of grouped anagrams. These lists are the output of the function. **

        return total_dist - min_diff
```
This solution works as follows:

1. Calculate the total distance the squirrel needs to travel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree. This is done by summing up the distances from the tree to each nut and then multiplying by 2 (since the squirrel needs to travel to each nut twice).

2. Initialize a variable `min_diff` to infinity. This will store the minimum difference between the total distance and the distance the squirrel needs to travel to collect the nuts without putting them under the tree.

3. Iterate through each nut and calculate the difference between the total distance and the distance the squirrel needs to travel to collect the nut without putting it under the tree. This is done by subtracting the distance from the squirrel to the nut from the distance from the tree to the nut.

4. Update `min_diff` with the minimum difference found.

5. Return the total distance minus `min_diff`, which gives the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` 73%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž  | 22/30 [05:06<01:51, 13.91s/it]

This solution works by converting the integer `n` to its base 3 representation. If there are any digits '2' in the base 3 representation, then `n` cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

**Code solution:** 
 
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumRequests(self, n: int, requests: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(i, cnt, in_degree, out_degree):
            if i == len(requests):
                return cnt if in_degree == out_degree else float('-inf')
            
            # Include the current request
            include = dfs(i + 1, cnt + 1, in_degree + requests[i][0], out_degree + requests[i][1])
            
            # Exclude the current request
            exclude = dfs(i + 1, cnt, in_degree, out_degree)
            
            return max(include, exclude)
        
        return dfs(0, 0, 0, 0)
```

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible combinations of including or excluding each request. The DFS function takes four parameters: the current index in the requests array, the count of included requests, the current in-degree (number of people moving out), and the current out-degree (number of people moving in).

At each step, the function makes two choices:
1. Include the current request and update the in-degree and out-degree accordingly.
2. Exclude the current request and keep the current in-degree and out-degree unchanged.

The function returns the maximum count of included requests that satisfy the condition (in-degree equals out-degree) for all buildings. If no such combination is found, it returns negative infinity. The initial call to the DFS function starts with the first request and a count of zero. The final result is the maximum count of included requests found during the search.

        def dfs(node):

            return dfs(node.right)
        
        return dfs(cloned)
``` 

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to find the target node in the cloned tree. The `dfs` function traverses the tree recursively and checks if the current node's value matches the target node's value. If a match is found, the function returns the current node. If no match is found in the left subtree, the function searches the right subtree. If the target node is not found, the function returns `None`. Finally, the `getTargetCopy` function calls the `dfs` function on the cloned tree and returns the result. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because it needs to visit each node once. The space complexity of the solution is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. However, since the height of the tree is limited to O(log n) in a balanced tree, the space complexity is effectively O(log n). 

If repeated values on the tree are allowed, the solution would need to be modified to handle cases where there are multiple nodes with the same value. One way to handle this would be to modify the `dfs` function to return a list of matching nodes instead of a single node. Then, the `getTargetCopy` function could return the first node in the list of matching nodes. However, this would require additional logic to handle cases where there are multiple nodes with the same value. Another way to handle this would be to modify the `dfs` function to skip over duplicate values by using a set to store previously visited node values. However, this would require additional logic to handle cases where the target node is not found. The exact solution would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.

```
This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize `patches` to keep track of the number of patches needed, `i` to iterate through the `nums` array, and `curr_sum` to keep track of the current sum of numbers we can form.

2. We use a while loop to continue adding patches until `curr_sum` reaches or exceeds `n`.

3. Inside the loop, we check if the current number in `nums` (if we have any left) can be added to `curr_sum` without exceeding `curr_sum + 1`. If it can, we add it to `curr_sum` and move to the next number in `nums`.

4. If the current number in `nums` cannot be added to `curr_sum`, we add `curr_sum + 1` to `curr_sum` and increment the `patches` counter.

5. Finally, we return the total number of patches needed. The while loop ensures that we can always form all numbers from 1 to `n` using the minimum number of patches.

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible ways to split the string. The `dfs` function takes two arguments: `index`, which represents the current position in the string, and `last_num`, which represents the last number encountered in the split. 

The function checks if the current index is equal to the length of the string, in which case it returns `True` because the entire string has been split. If not, it iterates through the string starting from the current index, converting the substring to an integer. If the integer is less than the last number encountered, it breaks out of the loop because the split order is invalid. Otherwise, it recursively calls the `dfs` function with the updated index and the current integer as the new last number. If a valid split is found, it returns `True`. If no valid split is found after exploring all possibilities, it returns `False`. Finally, the `splitString` function initializes the DFS with the starting index and the smallest possible integer as the last number encountered. The result of the DFS is returned as the output of the `splitString` function. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the string, because it explores all possible splits of the string. The space complexity is O(n) because the recursion stack can go as deep as the length of the string.

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `MOD` is set to \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.
   - Two 2D arrays, `dp` and `prev_dp`, are initialized to store the number of distinct sequences for each position `i` and each possible last roll `j`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - For `n = 1`, there are 6 possible sequences, so `dp[0][j] = 1` for all `j` from 0 to 5.

3. **Filling the DP Arrays**:
   - For each position `i` from 1 to `n-1`, iterate over all possible last rolls `j` and previous rolls `k`.
   - Check if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `j` and `k` is 1 and the absolute difference between `i` and the index of `k` in `dp[i-1]` is greater than 2.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, update `prev_dp[i][j]` by adding `dp[i-1][k]` modulo `MOD`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - For `n = n`, the total number of distinct sequences is the sum of all values in `prev_dp[n-1]` modulo `MOD`.

This solution efficiently calculates the number of distinct sequences using

    The algorithm calculates the penalty for each possible closing time of the shop by iterating through the `customers` string. For each hour, it updates the penalty based on whether a customer comes or not. It keeps track of the minimum penalty encountered and the corresponding closing hour. Finally, it returns the hour with the minimum penalty. The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the `customers` string. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few extra variables.

**Code solution:** 
 
```python
class Solution:
    def leftMostColumnWithOne(self, binaryMatrix: 'BinaryMatrix') -> int:
        rows, cols = binaryMatrix.dimensions()
        leftmost_col = cols  # Initialize to the maximum possible column index

        for row in range(rows):
            # Start from the rightmost column and move left

        # If leftmost_col is still cols, it means no 1 was found
        return leftmost_col if leftmost_col != cols else -1
```

This solution works by iterating over each row of the matrix. For each row, it starts from the rightmost column and moves left, checking for the first occurrence of `1`. If a `1` is found, it updates the `leftmost_col` to the current column index. After processing all rows, if `leftmost_col` is still `cols`, it means no `1` was found, and the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the `leftmost_col` index.

This solution uses two heaps: `buy_orders` (a max-heap) for buy orders and `sell_orders` (a min-heap) for sell orders. The algorithm processes each order as follows:

1. If the order is a buy order (`order_type == 0`), it tries to match it with the smallest available sell order (`sell_orders[0]`). If the sell order's price is less than or equal to the buy order's price, they are matched, and the sell order is removed from the heap. If the sell order's price is greater than the buy order's price, the buy order is added back to the heap.
2. If the order is a sell order (`order_type ==

    The algorithm splits the input sentence into individual words using the `split()` method. It then iterates over the words using a `for` loop, starting the index at 1 to match the 1-indexed requirement. For each word, it checks if the word starts with the `searchWord` using the `startswith()` method. If a match is found, it returns the current index. If no match is found after iterating through all the words, it returns -1. The use of `enumerate()` allows us to get both the index and the word in the same loop iteration.

This solution uses a recursive approach to split the linked list into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves. The `merge` function is used to combine the two sorted halves into a single sorted list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursive call stack. The follow-up question can be addressed by using a iterative approach instead of a recursive approach, which would have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). However, the recursive approach is more intuitive and easier to understand.

```
    
    The algorithm rotates the matrix in-place by performing two main operations:

1. **Transpose the Matrix**: This operation swaps the elements at positions `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` for all `i < j`. This effectively rotates the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

2. **Reverse Each Row**: After transposing, the rows need to be reversed to achieve the final 90-degree rotation. This is because the transposition operation reverses the columns, and reversing the rows further completes the 90-degree rotation.

This approach modifies the matrix in-place without using additional space, meeting the problem constraints. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix, and the space complexity is O(1) since no additional space is used.

    The algorithm first finds the middle of the list using the slow and fast pointers technique. Then, it reverses the second half of the list. Finally, it merges the two halves by alternating the nodes from each half. This ensures that the list is reordered to the desired form. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list, and the space complexity is O(1).

This solution works by maintaining a count of each character in the string `s`. It then iterates through each character in the string, and for each character, it finds the largest index `j` such that `count[j] > 0`. It decrements the count of character `j` and adds `i` to the result, where `i` is the current index of the character being processed. Finally, it returns the result modulo `10^9 + 7`. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string `s`, and the space complexity is O(1) since the count array has a fixed size of 26. However, this solution is not efficient for large input sizes due to its quadratic time complexity. A more efficient solution would use a combination of sorting and counting, but the problem constraints do not allow for such a solution. Therefore, this solution is provided as a reference implementation. 83%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž | 25/30 [05:48<01:08, 13.79s/it]

```
    
    The algorithm uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. It first sorts the workers based on the ratio of their wage to their quality. Then, it uses a min-heap to keep track of the `k` workers with the lowest quality. The algorithm iterates through the sorted workers, updating the total quality of the `k` workers and the minimum cost required to hire them. If the size of the heap exceeds `k`, it removes the worker with the highest quality from the heap. Finally, it returns the minimum cost required to hire exactly `k` workers. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the heap. The algorithm ensures that the minimum cost is achieved by always hiring the `k` workers with the lowest quality, while maintaining the ratio of their wage to their quality. The final result is within `10^-5` of the actual answer due to the nature of the problem and the constraints.

This solution uses backtracking to explore all possible configurations of the queens on the board. The `is_valid` function checks if placing a queen at a given position is valid, considering the constraints of no two queens attacking each other. The `backtrack` function recursively tries placing queens on the board, updating the state of columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals accordingly. When a complete solution is found, it is added to the result list. The final result is a list of all distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle.

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths the knight can take from the starting position `(r, c)` in `K` moves. It keeps track of the number of valid paths that remain on the board and calculates the probability by dividing the number of valid paths by the total number of possible paths (`8^K`).

The `dfs` function takes the current position `(x, y)` and the remaining number of moves `k` as parameters. If the knight is out of bounds or has no more moves left, it returns 0. If the knight has completed all `K` moves, it returns 1, indicating that the knight remains on the board.

If the knight has not completed all `K` moves, the function explores all possible moves in the eight directions and recursively calls itself for each move. It multiplies the probabilities of the valid paths by `1/8` to account for the uniform probability of each move.

Finally, the `knightProbability` function initializes the DFS process with the starting position `(r, c)` and the number of moves `K`, and returns the calculated probability.

This code defines a recursive depth-first search (DFS) function `dfs` that traverses the tree. If the current level is odd, it swaps the values of the current node and its right child using bitwise XOR operations. The DFS function is called recursively for the left and right children of the current node, increasing the level by 1 each time. Finally, the modified tree is returned.

*** Leetcode Example Question 5 ***
Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return all possible word break combinations of `s` using the words in `wordDict`.

Each word in `wordDict` can be used more than once. A word cannot be reused in the same combination.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "catsanddog", wordDict = \["cat","sand","dog"\]
**Output:** \["cats and dog","cat sand dog"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = \["apple","pen","applepen","pineapple"\]
**Output:** \["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepenapple"\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "catsandog", wordDict = \["cats","dog","sand"\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10`
*   `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   All the strings in `wordDict` are **unique**.
**Code solution:** 
 
    ```python

            max_score = max(max_score, score)
        
        return max_score
```
This solution works as follows:

1. We first build an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given edges and scores.

2. We initialize a variable `max_score` to store the maximum score of a valid node sequence.

3. We iterate over each edge `(u, v)` in the graph.

4. For each edge, we get the three neighbors of `u` and `v` with the highest scores in descending order.

5. We check if `u` and `v` are connected by verifying if the neighbor of `u` is `v` and the neighbor of `v` is `u`.

6. If they are connected, we calculate the score of the sequence `(u, neighbors_u[0][0], neighbors_v[0][0], v)` and update `max_score` if it is greater than the current `max_score`.

7. Finally, we return `max_score`.

This solution ensures that we consider all possible valid node sequences of length 4 and find the one with the maximum score.

    The algorithm first defines a helper function `is_k_mirror` to check if a number is a k-mirror number. It then defines another helper function `generate_k_mirror` to generate all possible k-mirror numbers with a given length by swapping the last digit with k-1.

The main function `kMirror` generates all possible k-mirror numbers with increasing lengths until it finds the required number of k-mirror numbers. It uses a helper function `find_k_mirrors` to filter out the valid k-mirror numbers and returns their sum. The algorithm ensures that the required number of k-mirror numbers is found by incrementing the length until the count exceeds the required number of k-mirror numbers. Finally, it returns the sum

```
    
The provided code defines a `Solution` class with a method `restoreString` that takes a string `s` and an integer array `indices` as input. It restores the original string by rearranging the characters based on the given indices.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A list `result` of the same length as `s` is initialized with empty strings. This list will store the characters in their correct positions after rearrangement.

2. **Rearrangement**:
   - The code iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it places the character at the index specified by the corresponding element in the `indices` array. This is done using `result[indices[i]] = s[i]`.

3. **Joining the Result**:
   - After rearranging all characters, the `result` list is joined into a single string using `''.join(result)`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The function returns the restored string.

This approach ensures that each character in the original string `s` is placed at the correct index specified by the `indices` array, effectively restoring the original string. The constraints guarantee that the indices are unique and within the bounds of the string length, so this method will always work correctly. Here is the complete solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        result = [''] * len(s)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            result[indices[i]] = s[i]
        return ''.join(result)
```

This solution efficiently rearranges the characters in the string based on the provided indices and returns the restored string. The constraints ensure that the indices are unique and valid, making the solution straightforward and effective.

    def cycleLengthQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
``` Here is the implementation of the `cycleLengthQueries` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def cycleLengthQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        def get_lca(a, b):
            # Find the common ancestor of nodes a and b
            while a != b:
                if a > b:
                    a //= 2
                else:
                    b //= 2
            return a
        
        result = []
        for a, b in queries:
            lca = get_lca(a, b)
            # Calculate the length of the cycle by counting the number of edges
            # from the root to the LCA and then to both nodes
            length = int(log2(lca)) + 1 + int(log2(a // lca)) + 1 + int(log2(b // lca)) - 1
            result.append(length)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Common Ancestor Calculation (`get_lca` Function):**
   - The function calculates the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes `a` and `b` using a binary search approach.
   - It repeatedly divides the larger node by 2 until it matches the smaller node, effectively finding the LCA.

2. **Cycle Length Calculation:**
   - For each query `(a, b)`, we first find the LCA using the `get_lca` function.
   - The length of the cycle is calculated by counting the number of edges from the root to the LCA and then to both nodes `a` and `b`.
   - We use logarithms to determine the number of levels (edges) from the root to the LCA and from the LCA to each node.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - For each query, we calculate the cycle length and append it to the result list.

This solution efficiently computes the cycle lengths for each query using logarithmic operations, making it suitable for large inputs. The time complexity is O(m log n), where `m` is the number of queries and `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is O(1) for the additional variables used. Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!

    def shouldPrintMessage(self, timestamp: int, message: str) -> bool:
        # Implement the shouldPrintMessage method

**Code solution:** 
 
```python
class Logger:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the logger object with a dictionary to store message timestamps
        self.messages = {}

    def shouldPrintMessage(self, timestamp: int, message: str) -> bool:

        if message in self.messages:

        # Update the timestamp for the message
        self.messages[message] = timestamp
        return True
```


This solution uses a dictionary to store each message and its corresponding timestamp. When the `shouldPrintMessage` method is called, it checks if the message has been printed within the last 10 seconds by comparing the current timestamp with the stored timestamp. If the message has been printed within the last 10 seconds, it returns `False`; otherwise, it updates the timestamp for the message and returns `True`. This ensures that each unique message is printed at most every 10 seconds. Additionally, the dictionary allows for efficient retrieval and updating of message timestamps.

This solution works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `range_size` is initialized to `n - len(blacklist)`, representing the number of white numbers available for picking.
   - A dictionary `black_to_white` is created to map blacklisted numbers to their corresponding white numbers.
   - A variable `white_num` is initialized to `range_size` to represent the next available white number.

2. **Mapping Blacklisted Numbers**:
   - For each blacklisted number `b`:
     - If `b` is greater than or equal to `range_size`, it is skipped because it is already within the range of white numbers.
     - A loop is used to find a white number that is not blacklisted by incrementing `white_num` until a suitable white number is found.
     - The blacklisted number `b` is mapped to the corresponding white number `white_num` in the `black_to_white` dictionary.
     - `white_num` is incremented to prepare for the next mapping.

3. **Picking a Random Number**:
   - A random number `rand_num` is selected within the range `[0, range_size - 1]`.
   - If `rand_num` is found in the `black_to_white` dictionary, it is replaced with its corresponding white number using the `black_to_white` dictionary.
   - The function returns the selected number.

This solution works as follows:

4. We initialize the total number of pairs of unreachable nodes to 0.
5. We iterate over each node in the graph. If the node has not been visited, we perform DFS on the node and calculate the size of the current connected component.
6. We add the product of the size of the current component and the remaining nodes to the total number of pairs.
7. Finally, we return the total number of pairs of unreachable nodes divided by 2. This is because each pair is counted twice

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We start by checking if the array is empty. If it is, we return 0 because there are no elements to form a subarray.
- **Variables**:
  - `n` is the length of the array.
  - `max_length` keeps track of the maximum length of a turbulent subarray found so far.
  - `current_length` is used to calculate the length of the current turbulent subarray.
- **Iteration**: We iterate through the array starting from the second element.
  - If the current element is equal to the previous element, we reset `current_length` to 1 because the subarray cannot be turbulent.
  - If the current element is greater than the previous element and the index is even, or if the current element is less than the previous element and the index is odd, we increment `current_length` because the subarray is turbulent.
  - If the current element breaks the turbulence pattern, we reset `current_length` to 2 because the next two elements must form a new turbulent subarray.
- **Update Maximum Length**: After updating `current_length`, we update `max_length` if `current_length` is greater than the current `max_length`.
- **Return Result**: Finally, we return `max_length`, which represents the length of the longest turbulent subarray. 
This approach efficiently finds the longest turbulent subarray with a time complexity of O(n).

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. The `dfs` function is a recursive helper function that takes a node and a current path as arguments. If the current node is `None`, the function returns immediately. Otherwise, the current node's value is appended to the path, and if the node is a leaf (i.e., both left and right children are `None`), the current path is added to the `paths` list. The function then recursively calls itself for the left and right children, and finally removes the last element from the path to backtrack. The `binaryTreePaths` function initializes an empty list `paths` and calls the `dfs` function starting from the root node. Finally, it returns the list of all root-to-leaf paths.

This solution uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph formed by the given points. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Calculate the Manhattan distance between each pair of points and store the distances in a list of edges.
2. Sort the edges by their weight (Manhattan distance).
3. Initialize the parent array for Union-Find to keep track of the connected components.
4. Use Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST:
   - While there are fewer than n-1 edges in the MST:
     - Pop the edge with the smallest weight from the priority queue.
     - Find the roots of the two points connected by the

```
This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of a substring that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. The `left` pointer marks the start of the current window, and the `right` pointer marks the end of the current window. The `current_cost` variable keeps track of the total cost of changing the characters in the current window. If the `current_cost` exceeds `maxCost`, the `left` pointer is moved to the right until the `current_cost` is within the allowed limit. The `max_length` variable keeps track of the maximum length of the current window. The function returns the `max_length` after iterating through the entire string.

```    
    The algorithm uses a deque to store the timestamps of the requests. In each call to the `ping` method, the current timestamp `t` is appended to the deque.

To ensure that only requests within the last 3000 milliseconds are counted, the algorithm checks if the timestamp at the front of the deque is older than `t - 3000`. If so, it removes the oldest timestamp from the deque using the `popleft` method.

Finally, the algorithm returns the length of the deque, which represents the number of requests that have happened in the last 3000 milliseconds.

    The algorithm sorts both the `hens` and `grains` arrays. Then, for each hen, it uses a binary search to find the earliest grain that can be eaten by the hen. The time taken for this is the difference between the current index of the grain and the current index of the hen plus one. The algorithm keeps track of the minimum time required to eat all grains. Finally, it returns the minimum time required. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log m), where n is the length of the `hens` array and m is the length of the `grains` array. The space complexity is O(1).

        count = 0

This solution works as follows:

1. The `__init__` method initializes the object with the given array `nums`.

2. The `pick` method takes a `target` number as input and returns a random index of the `target` number in the array.

3. The method iterates over the array and counts the occurrences of the `target` number.

4. For each occurrence of the `target` number, it generates a random number between 0 and 1 using `random.random()`.

5. If the random number is less than `1 / count`, it updates the result to the current index `i`.

6. Finally, it returns the result.

This solution ensures that each index of the `target` number has an equal probability of being returned. The use of the random number generator helps achieve this randomness. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we need to iterate over the array once to count the occurrences of the `target` number and another time to select a random index. The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size. ```python
```python
from random import random

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, nums):
        self.nums = nums
        self.indices = {}

    def pick(self, target):
        if target not in self.indices:
            self.indices[target] = []
        
        if len(self.indices[target]) == 0:

        else:
            last_index = self.indices[target][-1]
            new_index = last_index + random()
            self.indices[target].append(new_index)
        
        return self.indices[target][-1]
```
This solution works as follows:

1. The `__init__` method initializes the object with the given array `nums` and an empty dictionary `indices` to store the indices of the `target` numbers.

        return max_length
```


This solution works as follows:

1. **Combine Words**: Combine `word1` and `word2` into a single string `combined_word`.

2. **Initialize DP Table**: Create a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `combined_word[i:j+1]`.

3. **Fill DP Table**: Use a nested loop to fill the DP table. For each substring of length `length`, check if the characters at the start and end of the substring are the same. If they are, the length of the palindromic subsequence is the length of the subsequence excluding these two characters plus two. If they are not, the length of the palindromic subsequence is the maximum of the lengths of the subsequences excluding the first or last character.

4. **Calculate Maximum Length**: Iterate through `word1` and update the maximum length of palindromic subsequences found using `word1`.

5. **Return Result**: Return the maximum length of palindromic subsequences

```


### Explanation:

1. **Initial Check**: If the `points` list is empty, return 0 because no balloons to burst.

2. **Sorting**: Sort the `points` list based on their end coordinates (`p[1]`). This helps in efficiently determining the optimal placement of arrows.

3. **Initialization**: Initialize `arrows` to 1 because at least one arrow is needed to burst the first balloon. Set `prev_end` to the end coordinate of the first balloon.

4. **Iterate Through Points**: Loop through the sorted `points` starting from the second balloon:
   - If the start coordinate of the current balloon (`point[0]`) is greater than the `prev_end`, it means an additional arrow is needed to burst the current balloon. Increment `arrows` and update `prev_end` to the end coordinate of the current balloon.

5. **Return Result**: After iterating through all the balloons, return the total number of arrows needed.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of arrows is used to burst all the balloons efficiently. The sorting step reduces the complexity of finding the optimal placement of arrows.    
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not points:
            return 0
        
        # Sort the points based on their end coordinates
        points.sort(key=lambda p: p[1])
        
        arrows = 1
        prev_end = points[0][1]
        
        for point in points[1:]:
            if point[0] > prev_end:
                arrows += 1
                prev_end = point[1]
        
        return arrows
```    
This solution works by first sorting the points based on their end coordinates. This allows us to determine the optimal placement of arrows by always shooting at the end of the previous balloon that is still intact. We then iterate through the sorted points, updating the number of arrows needed and 97%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹| 29/30 [06:43<00:13, 13.87s/it]

                    largest_time = time_str
        
        return largest_time
```

This solution works by generating all possible permutations of the given digits. For each permutation, it extracts the hours and minutes and checks if the time is valid (between 00:00 and 23:59). If the time is valid, it converts the time to a string in the HH:MM format and updates the largest time if the current time is larger. Finally, it returns the largest valid time found. If no valid time is found, it returns an empty string. Note that this solution assumes that the input array contains exactly four digits. If the input array contains fewer than four digits, it may raise an error or produce unexpected results. If the input array contains more than four digits, it may produce duplicate permutations. To handle these cases, additional error checking and handling would need to be added. However, the given problem statement guarantees that the input array contains exactly four digits, so this solution should work correctly for that case. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(24!), which is impractical for large input sizes. A more efficient solution would involve reducing the number of permutations to consider by eliminating invalid permutations early on. However, this would require additional logic and may make the code

**Code solution:** 
 
```python
class Solution:
    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return False
``` 

This solution directly returns `False` because any integer `n` greater than or equal to 4 cannot be strictly palindromic across all bases from 2 to `n-2`. The logic is based on the fact that converting a number to a base greater than 1 will always result in a string that is not a palindrome for numbers greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, the function immediately returns `False` without further checks.

    In this solution, we maintain a buffer `buf4` of size 4 to store the characters read from the file using the `read4` method. We also maintain three variables: `n4` to store the number of characters currently available in `buf4`, `idx` to track the current index in `buf4`, and `cnt` to count the number of characters read so far.

In the `read` method, we repeatedly read characters from `buf4` and copy them to the destination buffer `buf`. We continue reading until either `n` characters are read or there are no more characters available in `buf4`.

If `buf4` is empty after reading, we call `read4` again to refill `buf4` and reset `idx` to 0. If `read4` returns 0, we break out of the loop and return the number of characters read so far. Otherwise, we increment `cnt` and `idx` to read the next character from `buf4`. Finally, we return the number of characters read.
