    def addPoly(self, poly1: 'PolyNode', poly2: 'PolyNode') -> 'PolyNode':
```

To solve the problem of adding two polynomial linked lists, we can follow these steps:

1. Traverse both polynomial linked lists simultaneously.
2. Compare the powers of the current nodes from both lists.
3. If the powers are equal, add the coefficients and create a new node with the result. Then move to the next nodes in both lists.
4. If the power of the first list's node is greater, create a new node with the power and coefficient of the first list's node and move to the next node in the first list.
5. If the power of the second list's node is greater, create a new node with the power and coefficient of the second list's node and move to the next node in the second list.
6. Continue this process until all nodes from both lists have been processed.
7. Return the head of the resulting polynomial linked list.

Let's implement the `beautySum` method to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def beautySum(self, s: str) -> int:
        def calculate_beauty(freq):
            min_freq = float('inf')
            max_freq = float('-inf')
            for freq_count in freq.values():
                if freq_count > 0:
                    min_freq = min(min_freq, freq_count)
                    max_freq = max(max_freq, freq_count)
            return max_freq - min_freq
        
        total_beauty = 0
        n = len(s)

            for j in range(i, n):
                freq[s[j]] += 1
                total_beauty += calculate_beauty(freq)
        
        return total_beauty
```

### Explanation:

1. **Helper Function `calculate_beauty`:**
   - This function calculates the beauty of a substring given its frequency dictionary.
   - It finds the minimum and maximum frequencies of characters in the substring and returns their difference.

2. **Main Function `beautySum`:**
   - We initialize `total_beauty` to store the sum of beauty values for all substrings.
   - We iterate over all possible starting points `i` of substrings.
   - For each starting point `i`, we use a frequency dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each character in the substring from `i` to `j`.
   - We calculate the beauty of the substring using the `calculate_beauty` function and add it to `total_beauty`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, we return the total beauty value.

class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of sorting an array based on the frequency of its elements, we can follow these steps:

1. Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. Sort the elements first by their frequency in increasing order.
3. For elements with the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.
4. Construct the sorted array based on the sorted list of elements.

Here's the Python implementation of the `frequencySort` method:

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
        frequency = Counter(nums)
        
        # Step 2: Sort the elements based on frequency and value
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (frequency[x], -x))
        
        return sorted_nums
```

### Explanation:

- **Counter**: We use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the array.
- **Sorting**: The `sorted` function is used with a custom key:
  - `(frequency[x], -x)`: This ensures that elements are first sorted by their frequency in increasing order. If two elements have the same frequency, they are then sorted by their value in decreasing order.
- **Return**: The sorted list of elements is returned as the result.

This approach efficiently sorts the array according to the specified criteria using Python's built-in capabilities. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the frequency counts.

        result = (result + count) % mod

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest rectangle that encompasses all the operations. This rectangle will have its width and height equal to the minimum of the first elements of each operation and the second elements of each operation, respectively. The number of maximum integers in the matrix will be the product of these dimensions.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not ops:
            return m * n
        
        min_width = min(op[0] for op in ops)
        min_height = min(op[1] for op in ops)
        
        return min_width * min_height
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check for Empty Operations**: If the `ops` list is empty, the entire matrix is initially filled with zeros. Therefore, the maximum integer is `m * n`.

2. **Find Minimum Dimensions**: Iterate through the `ops` list to find the minimum width (`min_width`) and minimum height (`min_height`). These are the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that encompasses all the operations.

3. **Calculate Maximum Integers**: The number of maximum integers in the matrix is the product of `min_width` and `min_height`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the result with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, and a space complexity of O(1). The constraints are handled appropriately within the function.
ref:
def maxCount(m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        m = min(m, op[0])

                return False
        
        return True
```

This code defines a function `possibleBipartition` that takes an integer `N` and a list of dislikes as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it is possible to split the people into two groups such that no two people who dislike each other are in the same group. The function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph and assign colors to the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If a cycle is detected, it means that it is not possible to split the people into two groups, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function initializes a dictionary `graph` to store the adjacency list of the graph, a set `visited` to keep track of the visited nodes, and a helper function `dfs` to perform the DFS traversal. The main loop iterates over all nodes in the graph and calls the `dfs` function to assign colors to the nodes.

    def checkIfPangram(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
        # Check if all 26 letters are present in the sentence
        return len(set(sentence)) == 26
```

This code works by converting the sentence into a set of characters. Since sets automatically remove duplicates, the length of the set will be 26 if and only if all 26 letters of the alphabet are present in the sentence. Therefore, the function returns `True` if the sentence is a pangram and `False` otherwise. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the sentence, because creating a set takes linear time relative to the number of unique characters in the sentence. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, as the set may contain all 26 letters of the alphabet. However, in practice, the space complexity will be much smaller since sets do not store duplicate values. 

The constraints are handled by the problem statement, which specifies that the sentence will contain only lowercase English letters and has a maximum length of 1000 characters. Therefore, the solution should work correctly for any valid input within these constraints. 

Here's an example of how you can use this code:

```python
sentence1 = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
print(checkIfPangram(sentence1))  # Output: True

sentence2 = "leetcode"
print(checkIfPangram(sentence2))  # Output: False
```

This code will output `True` for the first sentence and `False` for the second sentence, as expected. 

Note that the code assumes that the input sentence is non-empty, which is consistent with the problem statement. If the input sentence could be empty, you would need to add additional checks to handle that case. Here's an updated version of the code that handles empty sentences:

```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfPangram(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
        # Check if all 26 letters are present in the sentence
        if not sentence:
            return False
        return len(set(sentence)) == 26
```

This updated code checks if the input sentence is empty before attempting to create a set of characters. If the sentence is empty, it returns `False`, indicating that it cannot be a pangram. Otherwise, it proceeds with the same logic as before.

        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of finding the longest non-empty subarray containing only `1`s after deleting one element from the given binary array `nums`, we can use a sliding window approach. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        max_length = 0
        left = 0
        zero_count = 0
        
        for right in range(n):
            # If the current element is 0, increment the zero count
            if nums[right] == 0:
                zero_count += 1
            
            # If there are more than one zeros, move the left pointer
            while zero_count > 1:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zero_count -= 1
                left += 1
            
            # Calculate the length of the current valid subarray
            current_length = right - left + 1
            # Update the maximum length found
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        
        return max_length - 1 if max_length == n else max_length
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `max_length` to store the maximum length of the subarray, `left` as the starting index of the window, and `zero_count` to keep track of the number of zeros in the current window.

2. **Sliding Window**: We iterate through the array using the `right` pointer:
   - If the current element is `0`, we increment the `zero_count`.
   - If the `zero_count` exceeds `1`, we move the `left` pointer to the right until the `zero_count` is `1` again. This ensures that at most one zero is allowed in the window.

3. **Calculate Length**: For each valid window, we calculate the length of the subarray using `right - left + 1` and update `max_length` if this length is greater.

4. **Edge Case**: If `max_length` equals the length of the array, it means all elements are `1`s, so we return `max_length - 1` to exclude the last element. Otherwise, we return `max_length`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest subarray containing only `1`s after deleting one element in

```

This solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible additive sequences. The `backtrack` function takes the current starting index and the current path of numbers as arguments. It checks if the current path has at least three numbers and if the current starting index is equal to the length of the input string, indicating that a valid sequence has been found. If not, it iterates over all possible substrings starting from the current index and appends them to the path if they satisfy the additive sequence condition. If a valid sequence is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The `isAdditiveNumber` method initializes the backtracking process with the starting index of 0 and an empty path. ```python

        return False
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Generate Permutations**: We generate all possible permutations of the digits in the integer `N` using `itertools.permutations` and convert them to integers.

2. **Check for Power of Two**: We iterate over powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{30}\) (since \(2^{30} \times 10^9\) is the largest possible value for \(N\)). For each power of two, we check if it is a subset of the set of permutations. If it is, then `N` can be reordered to form a power of two.

3. **Return Result**: If any permutation of `N` matches a power of two, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible permutations and powers of two to determine if `N` can be reordered to form a power of two. The use of sets for membership testing allows for quick checks, making the solution both efficient and easy to understand.

            # Add the current character to the window
            char = s[right]
            window_count[char] += 1

            while left <= right and formed == len(t_count):

                    min_length = right - left + 1

                char = s[left]
                window_count[char] -= 1

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize counters for `t` and the current window, set pointers for the sliding window, and variables to track the minimum length and window.

2. **Sliding Window**: We expand the window by moving the right pointer and add characters to the window's counter. If a character is needed from `t`, we increment the `formed` count.

3. **Contracting the Window**: When the number of characters in the window that match those

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `kSimilarity` that calculates the minimum number of swaps required to transform `s1` into `s2`. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible transformations and keeps track of visited states to avoid redundant calculations. The `get_next` function identifies the first differing character in `s1` and `s2` and returns all possible swaps that can be made to match the characters at these positions. The `dfs` function recursively explores each possible swap and returns the minimum number of steps required to reach `s2`. The `visited` set ensures that each state is processed only once. The final result is the minimum number of swaps required to transform `s1` into `s2`. 

The provided constraints ensure that the input strings are valid anagrams of each other, and the code handles the given examples correctly. However, the time complexity of this approach is exponential due to the DFS exploration of all possible transformations, making it suitable for small input sizes as specified. For larger inputs, more efficient algorithms or optimizations might be necessary. 

If you have any questions or need further clarification on any part of the code, feel free to ask!

Here is the solution code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minArea(self, image: List[List[str]], x: int, y: int) -> int:
        m, n = len(image), len(image[0])
        
        # Find the first and last row with black pixels
        first_row, last_row = None, None
        for i in range(m):
            if '1' in image[i]:
                if first_row is None:
                    first_row = i
                last_row = i
        
        # Find the first and last column with black pixels
        first_col, last_col = None, None
        for j in range(n):
            if any(image[i][j] == '1' for i in range(m)):
                if first_col is None:
                    first_col = j
                last_col = j
        
        # Calculate the area of the smallest rectangle
        if first_row is not None and last_row is not None and first_col is not None and last_col is not None:
            return (last_row - first_row + 1) * (last_col - first_col + 1)
        else:
            return 0
```

This solution works as follows:

1. It first determines the first and last rows with black pixels by iterating through each row and checking if there is at least one black pixel ('1').

2. Similarly, it determines the first and last columns with black pixels by iterating through each column and checking if there is at least one black pixel in that column.

3. Once the first and last rows and columns are identified, it calculates the area of the smallest rectangle that encloses all black pixels using the formula `(last_row - first_row + 1) * (last_col - first_col + 1)`.

4. If no black pixels are found, it returns 0.

This approach ensures that the solution runs in O(m + n) time complexity, which is less than O(mn) for this problem. The constraints guarantee that there is only one black region, so we can safely assume that the first and last rows and columns will be found. Additionally, the constraints also ensure that the input matrix is small enough to fit within the memory limits of most standard programming environments. Therefore, this solution should work efficiently for the given constraints.

This Python code defines a `Solution` class with a `maskPII` method that masks either an email address or a phone number according to the specified rules. The method checks if the input string contains an "@" symbol to determine whether it's an email or a phone number and then applies the appropriate masking logic. The solution handles both cases efficiently and correctly according to the problem constraints. ```python

class Solution:
    def maxWidthRamp(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of finding the maximum width of a ramp in an integer array, we can use a combination of a stack and sorting. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxWidthRamp(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Create a list of tuples (value, index) and sort by value
        sorted_nums = sorted((value, index) for index, value in enumerate(nums))
        
        # Initialize the stack with the last element's index
        stack = [sorted_nums[-1][1]]
        
        # Initialize the result to 0
        result = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted list from the second last element to the first
        for value, index in sorted_nums[:-1][::-1]:
            # While the stack is not empty and the current value is greater than or equal to the top of the stack
            while stack and value >= nums[stack[-1]]:
                # Calculate the width of the ramp and update the result if necessary
                result = max(result, index - stack.pop())
            # Push the current index onto the stack
            stack.append(index)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: We first create a list of tuples `(value, index)` and sort it by the value. This allows us to efficiently find the largest possible ramp using the smallest indices.

2. **Stack Initialization**: We initialize a stack with the index of the last element in the sorted list. This serves as the starting point for our ramp.

3. **Iterating and Updating**: We iterate through the sorted list from the second last element to the first. For each element, we check if it can form a ramp with the elements already in the stack. If it can, we calculate the width of the ramp and update the result if necessary. We then push the current index onto the stack.

4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all elements, the result will be the maximum width of any ramp found.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum width ramp in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes. The use of sorting helps in reducing the complexity of finding the largest possible ramp.

class Solution:
    def numWays(self, steps: int, arrLen: int) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. The idea is to keep track of the number of ways to reach each index after a certain number of steps. We will use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, steps: int, arrLen: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Maximum possible distance from the center
        max_distance = min(steps // 2, arrLen - 1)
        
        # Memoization dictionary to store the number of ways to reach each index
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(step, pos):
            if step == 0:
                return 1 if pos == 0 else 0
            if pos < 0 or pos > max_distance:
                return 0
            
            # Move to the left, right, or stay in the same place
            return (dp(step - 1, pos - 1) +
                    dp(step - 1, pos) +
                    dp(step - 1, pos + 1)) % MOD
        
        return dp(steps, 0)
```

### Explanation:

1. **MODulo Operation**: We use `MOD = 10**9 + 7` to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

2. **Maximum Distance**: We calculate the maximum possible distance from the center (`max_distance`) because moving more than half the steps away from the center will never lead back to the starting position.

3. **Memoization**: We use a recursive function `dp(step, pos)` with memoization (`@lru_cache(None)`) to store the number of ways to reach each index after a certain number of steps. This avoids recalculating the same subproblem multiple times.

4. **Base Case**: If `step` is 0, we check if the current position `pos` is 0. If it is, we return 1; otherwise, we return 0.

5. **Recursive Case**: For each position `pos`, we consider three possible moves: moving to the left, moving to the right, or staying in the same place. We sum up the number of ways for each move and take the result modulo `MOD`.


ref:
from functools import lru_cache

mod = 10**9 + 7

def numOfWays(steps: int, arrLen: int) -> int:
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dp(s, p):
        if p < 0 or p >= arrLen or p > steps - p:
            return 0
        if s == 0:
            return p == 0
        return (dp(s - 1, p - 1) + dp(s - 1, p) + dp(s - 1, p + 1)) % mod

    return dp(steps, 0)

class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
```

To solve the problem of finding the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range \([left, right]\), we can use a bit manipulation approach. The key observation is that as we move from `left` to `right`, there will be a point where the bits become different. This is because the range includes numbers with different binary representations.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the result to the maximum possible value
        result = 0
        
        # Iterate over the bits of the numbers
        for i in range(31, -1, -1):
            # Get the current bit of both left and right
            bit_left = (left >> i) & 1
            bit_right = (right >> i) & 1
            
            # If the bits are different, break the loop
            if bit_left != bit_right:
                break
            
            # If the bits are the same, set the corresponding bit in the result
            result |= (bit_left << i)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `result` to 0. This variable will hold the final bitwise AND result.

2. **Bit Iteration**: We iterate over each bit position from 31 to 0 (since 31 is the highest bit position for a 32-bit integer).

3. **Extracting Bits**: For each bit position `i`, we extract the bit from both `left` and `right` using bitwise right shift (`>>`) and bitwise AND (`&`).

4. **Comparison**: If the bits at the current position are different (`bit_left != bit_right`), it means the range includes numbers with different binary representations, and we can break the loop early.

5. **Setting Result**: If the bits are the same, we set the corresponding bit in the `result` using bitwise OR (`|`) and left shift (`<<`).

6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `result`, which contains the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range \([left, right]\). 

This approach efficiently finds the bitwise AND by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and iterating only over necessary bit positions. The time complexity is O(1) since
ref:
def range_bitwise_and(left: int, right: int) -> int:
    shift = 0
    while left != right:
        left >>= 1
        right >>= 1
        shift += 1
    return left << shift

To solve the given LeetCode problem, we can use a graph-based approach with a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the requirements:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def gardenNoAdj(self, n: int, paths: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Create an adjacency list representation of the graph
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y in paths:
            graph[x].append(y)
            graph[y].append(x)
        
        # Initialize the result list with default flower type 1
        result = [1] * n
        
        # Define a helper function to perform DFS
        def dfs(node):
            # Try each flower type from 1 to 4
            for flower in range(1, 5):
                # Check if the current flower type is not used by any neighbor
                if all(result[neighbor] != flower for neighbor in graph[node]):
                    # Assign the current flower type to the node
                    result[node - 1] = flower
                    break
        
        # Perform DFS starting from each node
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dfs(i)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Representation**: We first create an adjacency list to represent the graph using the given paths. This allows us to easily access the neighbors of each node.

2. **Result Initialization**: We initialize a result list `result` with size `n`, where each element is set to 1. This represents the initial flower type for each garden.

3. **DFS Function**: We define a helper function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search starting from a given node. For each node, we try each flower type from 1 to 4. If a flower type is available (i.e., it is not used by any of its neighbors), we assign it to the node and break out of the loop.

4. **Iterate Over Nodes**: We iterate over each node from 1 to `n` and call the `dfs` function to assign a flower type to each garden.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains the flower types for each garden.

This approach ensures that for any two gardens connected by a path

    def maxXor(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], values: List[int]) -> int:
        pass
```

To solve the problem of finding the maximum possible score from two non-overlapping subtrees, we can use a combination of depth-first search (DFS) and bit manipulation. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree structure. This allows us to easily traverse the tree using DFS.

2. **DFS Traversal**: Perform a DFS to calculate the sum of values for each subtree. We'll also keep track of the maximum XOR value for each subtree.

3. **Bitwise XOR Calculation**: For each subtree, calculate the XOR of the sum of its values with the maximum XOR values of all other subtrees that do not overlap with it.

4. **Update Maximum Score**: Keep track of the maximum score obtained by considering all possible pairs of non-overlapping subtrees.

Here's the Python implementation:

class Solution:
    def maxPrice(self, items: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> float:
```

Sure! Below is the Python code for the `maxPrice` function as described in the problem statement:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxPrice(self, items: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> float:
        # Sort items by price per unit weight in descending order
        items.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] / x[1], reverse=True)
        
        total_price = 0
        
        for price, weight in items:
            if capacity >= weight:
                total_price += price
                capacity -= weight
            else:
                # Calculate the fraction of the item that can fit
                fraction = capacity / weight
                total_price += price * fraction
                break
        
        # If capacity is not fully utilized, check if more can be added
        if capacity > 0:
            return total_price
        
        return total_price
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: The items are sorted based on their price per unit weight in descending order. This ensures that we prioritize adding the most valuable items first.

2. **Iterating Through Items**: We iterate through each item, checking if its weight can fit within the remaining capacity.

3. **Adding Items**: If the item's weight fits, we add its full price to the total and reduce the capacity accordingly.

4. **Fractional Addition**: If the item's weight does not fit completely, we calculate the fraction of the item that can fit and add that fraction of the item's price to the total.

5. **Final Check**: After processing all items, if there is still capacity left, we check if more items can be added. If so, we add the fraction of the last item that can fit.

6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total price. If it is impossible to fill the bag, the function will naturally return the total price calculated up to the point where the capacity is fully utilized. If the capacity is fully utilized, the function will return the total price without any further modifications. 

This approach ensures that we maximize the total price while respecting the capacity constraint. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables.

                if child != parent:
                    # Get the counts from the child's subtree
                    child_counts = dfs(child, node)
                    
                    # Update the current node's label count with the child's counts
                    for label, count in child_counts.items():
                        label_count[label] += count

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Construction**: We first build an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This allows us to easily traverse the tree.

2. **Result Initialization**: We initialize a result array `result` of size `n` with zeros. Each element in this array will store the count of nodes with the same label as the corresponding node in the input tree.

3. **DFS Function**: We define a DFS function `dfs` that takes a node and its parent as arguments. This function returns a dictionary `label_count` containing the counts of each label in the subtree rooted at the current node.

4. **Label Counting**: For each node, we first count the occurrences of its label.

### Explanation:

1. **Stacks for Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - We use two stacks to keep track of indices of elements that are greater than or less than the current element.
   - For each element, we determine the range of indices where it is the maximum or minimum

This Python code defines a solution to the LeetCode problem "Friend Requests". The solution uses the Union-Find data structure to efficiently manage friend relationships and check for conflicts based on restrictions. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**: The `find` function is used to find the root of a set, and the `union` function is used to merge two sets.

2. **Processing Each Request**:
   - For each friend request `(u, v)`, a new set is created with each person labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The code iterates over the restrictions and checks if there is a conflict between the two people in the request and any restriction. If a conflict is found, the request is not successful.
   - If no conflict is found, the two people are unioned, and the request is considered successful.

3. **Result Construction**: A boolean list `result` is constructed to store the success status of each request.

4. **Return Result**: The function returns the `result` list containing the success status of each friend request.

This approach ensures that each friend request is processed efficiently, considering both direct and indirect friendships based on the given restrictions. The constraints of the problem allow this solution to run within the required time limits.

class Solution:
    def maximumBooks(self, books: List[int]) -> int:
        pass
```

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. The idea is to iterate through each shelf and determine the maximum number of books that can be taken from that shelf while maintaining the constraint that strictly fewer books are taken from each subsequent shelf.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumBooks(self, books: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(books)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i == n:
                return 0
            
            # Calculate the number of books to take from the current shelf
            books_taken = min(i + 1, books[i])
            
            # Calculate the sum of books taken from the previous shelves
            prev_sum = (books_taken * (books_taken + 1)) // 2 - books_taken * (books_taken - 1) // 2
            
            # Calculate the maximum number of books that can be taken from the current shelf
            max_books = books_taken + dp(i + 1)
            
            # Iterate through the next shelves to find the maximum number of books
            for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + books_taken)):
                books_taken_next = min(j - i + 1, books[j])
                prev_sum_next = (books_taken_next * (books_taken_next + 1)) // 2 - books_taken_next * (books_taken_next - 1) // 2
                max_books = max(max_books, books_taken_next + dp(j + 1))
            
            return max_books
        
        return dp(0)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Dynamic Programming Function (`dp`)**:
   - We define a recursive function `dp(i)` that returns the maximum number of books that can be taken starting from shelf `i`.
   - If `i` reaches the end of the list, we return 0 because there are no more shelves to consider.

2. **Books Taken Calculation**:
   - For each shelf, we calculate the number of books that can be taken, which is the minimum of the number of books available on that shelf and the current shelf index plus one.

3. **Sum of Books Calculation**:
   - We calculate the sum of books taken from the previous shelves using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

4. **Recursive Call**:
  
ref:
def max_books(books):
    n = len(books)
    max_books = 0
    
    for l in range(n):
        r = l + 1
        books_taken = books[l]
        min_taken = books[l]
        max_books = max(max_books, books_taken)
        
        while r < n:
            min_taken = min(min_taken, books[r])
            books_taken += min_taken
            max_books = max(max_books, books_taken)
            
            if min_taken <= 1:
                break  # Can't decrease further

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n * 4^k), where m and n are the dimensions of the board, and k is the length of the word. The space complexity is O(k) due to the recursion stack.

class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
```

To solve the problem of trimming a binary search tree (BST) based on given lower and upper bounds, we can use a recursive approach. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # If the current node's value is less than low, trim the left subtree
        if root.val < low:
            return self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)
        
        # If the current node's value is greater than high, trim the right subtree
        if root.val > high:
            return self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)
        
        # Recursively trim the left and right subtrees
        root.left = self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)
        root.right = self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)
        
        return root
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: If the `root` is `None`, return `None` because an empty tree cannot be trimmed.

2. **Trimming Logic**:
   - If the current node's value (`root.val`) is less than `low`, it means all nodes in the left subtree are also less than `low`. Therefore, we recursively trim the left subtree.
   - If the current node's value (`root.val`) is greater than `high`, it means all nodes in the right subtree are also greater than `high`. Therefore, we recursively trim the right subtree.

3. **Recursive Trimming**:
   - If the current node's value is within the range `[low, high]`, we recursively trim both the left and right subtrees.

4. **Return the Result**: After trimming, return the current node as the new root of the trimmed tree.

This approach ensures that the relative structure of the elements remains unchanged while only keeping nodes within the specified range. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited at most once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, the height of the tree can be O(n). However, for balanced trees, the space complexity is O(log n).

This implementation uses a list to store the elements of the HashSet. The `add` method appends the key to the list if it is not already present.

This approach ensures that all operations have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the HashSet.

However, it is important to note that this implementation may not perform well for very large input sizes due to the potential for many collisions.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make the substrings `s1[0...i-1]` and `s2[0...j-1]` equal.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `s1` is empty (`i = 0`), the cost to make it equal to `s2[0...j-1]` is the sum of ASCII values of all characters in `s2`.
   - Similarly, if `s2` is empty (`j = 0`), the cost to make it equal to `s1[0...i-1]` is the sum of ASCII values of all characters in `s1`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each character pair `(s1

This code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to solve the sliding puzzle problem. It converts the board into a single string for easier manipulation, defines possible moves, and uses a queue to explore all possible states of the board. The BFS ensures that the first solution found is the least number of moves required. If no solution is found, it returns -1. ```python

class Solution:
    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we need to generate the array `nums` where each element is calculated as `start + 2 * i`, and then compute the bitwise XOR of all elements in the array. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:
        # Generate the array nums
        nums = [start + 2 * i for i in range(n)]
        
        # Compute the bitwise XOR of all elements in nums
        result = 0
        for num in nums:
            result ^= num
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Generate the Array `nums`:**
   - We use a list comprehension to create the array `nums`. Each element is calculated as `start + 2 * i`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Compute the Bitwise XOR:**
   - We initialize a variable `result` to `0`.
   - We iterate over each element in the `nums` array and perform a bitwise XOR operation with `result`. This effectively accumulates the XOR of all elements in the array.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - Finally, we return the computed `result`, which is the bitwise XOR of all elements in the array.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

        while right < n:
            if count[s[right]] > target:
                balance += 1
            
            count[s[right]] -= 1
            right += 1
            
            # Shrink the window from the left until balance is zero
            while balance == 0:
                min_length = min(min_length, right - left)
                
                if count[s[left]] >= target:
                    balance -= 1
                
                count[s[left]] += 1
                left += 1
        
        return min_length
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Check if the string is already balanced**: We first check if the frequency of each character in the string is less than or equal to `n // 4`. If it is, the string is already balanced, and we return 0.

2. **Initialize variables for the sliding window**: We initialize `left` and `right` pointers to represent the current window, `min_length` to store the minimum length of the substring we need to replace, and `balance` to keep track of how many characters are out of balance.

3. **Expand the window**: We expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to the right and incrementing the count of the character at the `right` pointer. If the count of the character at the `right` pointer exceeds the target, we increment the `balance`.

4. **Shrink the window**: Once the `balance` is zero, it means we have a valid substring where all characters are within the target frequency. We then try to shrink the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer to the right and decrementing the count of the character at the `left` pointer.

This solution iterates through each element in the array. If the element has not been visited (i.e., it is not `-1`), it starts a new set by marking the current element as visited (`-1`). It then follows the chain of elements pointed to by the current element, marking each one as visited and incrementing the length of the set. Once a duplicate element is encountered, it stops following the chain and updates the maximum length found so far. Finally, it returns the maximum length of any set found.

   - Add the target cell to the `flipped` set and return its coordinates as a list `[row, col]`.

3. **Resetting the Matrix (`reset` method):**
   - Clear the `flipped` set to reset all cells to `0`.
   - Recalculate the total number of cells (`total_cells`) in the matrix.

This approach ensures that each cell has an equal probability of being selected and flipped, and it minimizes the number of calls to the built-in random function by reusing the same random number generator. The time complexity for flipping a cell is O(1) on average, and the space complexity is O(m * n) for storing the flipped cells. The reset operation is O(1) in terms of time and space.

    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```

Sure! Below is the Python code for the `chalkReplacer` function based on the provided requirements:

```python
class Solution:
    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Calculate the total sum of chalk needed for one complete cycle
        total_sum = sum(chalk)
        
        # Reduce k by the total sum modulo k to handle cases where k is greater than the total sum
        k %= total_sum
        
        # Initialize variables to track the current chalk used and the index of the student
        current_chalk = 0
        index = 0
        
        # Iterate through the chalk array until we find the student who needs to replace the chalk
        while current_chalk < k:
            current_chalk += chalk[index]
            index = (index + 1) % len(chalk)
        
        return index
```

### Explanation:
1. **Calculate Total Sum**: We first calculate the total sum of all chalk needed for one complete cycle of students.

2. **Reduce k**: We reduce `k` by taking `k % total_sum`. This handles cases where `k` is greater than the total sum of chalk needed for one complete cycle, allowing us to determine the equivalent position within a single cycle.

3. **Initialize Variables**: We initialize `current_chalk` to keep track of the total chalk used so far and `index` to iterate through the chalk array.

4. **Iterate Through Chalk Array**: We iterate through the chalk array, adding the chalk needed for each student to `current_chalk`. If `current_chalk` exceeds `k`, we return the current `index`, indicating the student who needs to replace the chalk.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the student who needs to replace the chalk pieces using a single pass through the chalk array. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the chalk array, and the space complexity is O(1).

Sure, here's the Python code to solve the LeetCode problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def sequenceReconstruction(self, nums: List[int], sequences: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)

        start_nodes = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if indegree[i] == 0]
        
        # Check if there is exactly one starting node
        if len(start_nodes) != 1:
            return False
        
        # Perform topological sorting
        queue = deque(start_nodes)
        reconstructed_sequence = []
        
        while queue:
            if len(queue) > 1:
                return False
            
            node = queue.popleft()

        # Check if the reconstructed sequence matches the original sequence
        return reconstructed_sequence == nums
```

This solution uses a graph-based approach to determine if the given `nums` array is the shortest possible supersequence for the provided `sequences`. It leverages topological sorting to ensure that the sequence respects the order of dependencies defined by the `sequences`. If there is exactly one starting node with no incoming edges, and the topological sorting results in the correct sequence, then `nums` is the only shortest supersequence. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

```python
class Solution:
    def largestOddNumber(self, num: str) -> str:
        pass
```

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest odd integer that can be formed as a substring of the given string `num`. Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def largestOddNumber(self, num: str) -> str:
        # Iterate over the string from right to left
        for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
            # Check if the current character is odd
            if int(num[i]) % 2 != 0:
                # Return the substring from the start to the current index
                return num[:i + 1]
        # If no odd digit is found, return an empty string
        return ""
```

### Explanation:

1. **Iterate from Right to Left**: We start iterating from the last character of the string to the first. This ensures that we find the largest possible odd substring.

2. **Check for Odd Digit**: For each character, we convert it to an integer and check if it is odd using the modulus operator (`%`). If it is odd, we break out of the loop.

3. **Return the Substring**: Once we find an odd digit, we return the substring from the start of the string up to and including the current index.

4. **Return Empty String**: If no odd digit is found by the end of the loop, we return an empty string.

This approach efficiently finds the largest odd substring by leveraging the properties of odd and even numbers and the structure of the input string. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we only make a single pass through the string. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

def largest_odd_number(num: str) -> str:
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):

```python
class Solution:
    def calculateTax(self, brackets: List[List[int]], income: int) -> float:
        total_tax = 0
        
        # Iterate through each tax bracket
        for i in range(len(brackets)):
            # Calculate the taxable amount for the current bracket
            taxable_amount = min(income, brackets[i][0]) - (brackets[i - 1][0] if i > 0 else 0)
            
            # Calculate the tax for the current bracket and add it to the total tax
            total_tax += taxable_amount * (brackets[i][1] / 100)

            if income <= brackets[i][0]:
                break

This code calculates the total tax based on the given brackets and income. It iterates through each bracket, calculates the taxable amount, and adds the corresponding tax to the total. If the income is less than or equal to the current bracket's upper limit, it breaks early to avoid unnecessary calculations. Finally, it returns the total tax.

class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the cumulative sums encountered so far. This allows us to efficiently determine how many times a specific sum has been seen before, which helps in counting the number of subarrays that sum up to `k`.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of cumulative sums
        sum_count = {0: 1}  # Initialize with sum 0 occurring once
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            current_sum += num
            # Check if there is a previous sum that, when subtracted from current_sum, equals k
            if current_sum - k in sum_count:
                count += sum_count[current_sum - k]
            # Update the frequency of the current sum
            if current_sum in sum_count:
                sum_count[current_sum] += 1
            else:
                sum_count[current_sum] = 1
        
        return count
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a dictionary `sum_count` where the key is the cumulative sum and the value is the number of times that sum has occurred. We set `0` as a key with a value of `1` because a sum of `0` can be formed by an empty subarray.

2. **Iterate through the array**: For each element in the array, we update the `current_sum` by adding the current element.

3. **Check for valid subarrays**: We check if there is a previous cumulative sum (`current_sum - k`) in the dictionary. If it exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current index that sums up to `k`. We add the frequency of this previous sum to the `count`.

4. **Update the frequency**: We update the frequency of the current cumulative sum in the dictionary.

5. **Return the result**: Finally, we return the `count`, which represents the total number of subarrays that sum up to `k`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of subarrays with the desired sum using a hash map to keep track of cumulative sums. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length 20%|â–ˆâ–ˆ        | 6/30 [00:59<03:58,  9.92s/it]

class Solution:
    def findRoot(self, tree: List['Node']) -> 'Node':
        # Your code here
```

To solve the problem of finding the root of an N-ary tree given all its nodes, we can use the property that the root node appears only once in the list of nodes, while all other nodes appear twice. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def findRoot(self, tree: List['Node']) -> 'Node':
        # Use a set to track occurrences of node values
        seen = set()
        
        # Iterate through each node in the tree
        for node in tree:
            # Add the node's value to the set
            seen.add(node.val)
            
            # Add the values of all children to the set
            for child in node.children:
                seen.add(child.val)
        
        # The root node is the one that appears only once
        for node in tree:
            if node.val not in seen:
                return node
```

### Explanation:

1. **Set for Tracking Occurrences**: We use a set called `seen` to keep track of the values of all nodes encountered. This helps us identify which nodes appear only once.

2. **Iterate Through Nodes**: We iterate through each node in the list `tree`.

3. **Add Node Values**: For each node, we add its value to the `seen` set. This ensures that all nodes' values are recorded.

4. **Add Child Values**: We also add the values of all children of the current node to the `seen` set. This ensures that all child nodes' values are recorded.

5. **Find the Root**: After processing all nodes, we iterate through the list again to find the node whose value is not in the `seen` set. This node is the root because it appears only once.

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes, and uses O(n) space complexity for storing the node values. It efficiently finds the root node with a linear time and constant space solution.
ref:
class Solution:
    def findRoot(self, nodes: List['Node']) -> 'Node':
        value_sum = 0

            value_sum += node.val
            
            for child in node.children:
                value_sum -= child.val
        
        for node in nodes:
            if node.val == value_sum:

    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Your code here
```

To solve the problem of generating all possible permutations of a given list of distinct integers, you can use a recursive approach. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the requirements:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        
        def backtrack(path):
            if len(path) == len(nums):
                result.append(path[:])
                return
            
            for num in nums:
                if num not in path:
                    path.append(num)
                    backtrack(path)
                    path.pop()
        
        backtrack([])
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to store all the permutations.

2. **Backtracking Function**: We define a helper function `backtrack` that takes a current permutation `path` as an argument.

3. **Base Case**: If the length of `path` equals the length of `nums`, it means we have formed a complete permutation, so we append a copy of `path` to `result` and return.

4. **Recursive Case**: For each number in `nums`, if it is not already in `path`, we add it to `path`, recursively call `backtrack` with the updated `path`, and then remove the last element from `path` to explore other possibilities.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we call the `backtrack` function with an empty list as the initial path and return the `result` list containing all permutations.

This approach ensures that all permutations are generated and stored in the `result` list, which is returned at the end. The constraints of the problem (up to 6 distinct integers) make this approach feasible.

- We then calculate the number of jumbo burgers by subtracting twice the number of cheese slices from the number of tomato slices and dividing the result by 2.
- We then calculate the number of small burgers by subtracting the number of jumbo burgers from the number of cheese slices.
- If either the number of jumbo burgers or the number of small burgers is negative, it means it's impossible to make the remaining tomato and cheese slices equal to 0, so we return an empty list.
- Otherwise, we return a list containing the number of jumbo burgers and the number of small burgers. ```python

        # Count the frequency of each character in both strings
        count_s = collections.Counter(s)

```

This solution works as follows:

1. We use the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each character in both strings `s` and `t`.

2. We initialize a variable `steps` to 0, which will store the total number of steps needed to make the two strings anagrams.

3. We iterate over all lowercase English letters using `string.ascii_lowercase`. For each letter, we calculate the absolute difference between the frequency of the letter in `s` and the frequency of the letter in `t`. This difference represents the number of additional steps needed to include the letter in one of the strings to make it an anagram.

4. We add the calculated difference to the `steps` variable.

5. Finally, we return the `steps` variable, which contains the minimum number of steps needed to make the two strings anagrams. ```python

        # Calculate the number of steps needed to make the two strings anagrams
        steps = 0
        for char in string.ascii_lowercase:
            steps += abs(count_s[char] - count_t[char])

                    special_count += 1
        
        return special_count
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We first determine the dimensions of the matrix `m` and `n`.

2. We then count the number of `1`s in each row and column using list comprehensions. The `row_count` list contains the sum of elements in each row, and the `col_count` list contains the sum of elements in each column.

3. We initialize a variable `special_count` to keep track of the number of special positions.

4. We iterate through each cell in the matrix. For each cell, we check if the value is `1`, and if the corresponding row and column contain only one `1`. If both conditions are satisfied, we increment the `special_count`.

5. Finally, we return the `special_count`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of special positions in the matrix with a time complexity of O(m * n). The space complexity is also O(m + n) due to the storage of row and column counts. ```python

    def numSpecial(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:

Sure! Below is the Python code for the `sortFeatures` method based on the requirements provided in the LeetCode problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def sortFeatures(self, features: List[str], responses: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Create a dictionary to count the occurrences of each feature in the responses
        feature_count = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Iterate over each response
        for response in responses:
            # Split the response into individual words
            words = response.split()
            
            # Iterate over each word in the response
            for word in words:
                # If the word is in the features list, increment its count
                if word in features:
                    feature_count[word] += 1
        
        # Sort the features based on their count in non-increasing order
        # If two features have the same count, maintain their original order
        sorted_features = sorted(features, key=lambda x: (-feature_count[x], features.index(x)))
        
        return sorted_features
```

### Explanation:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: We use a `defaultdict` to count how many times each feature appears in the responses. This allows us to efficiently update the counts as we iterate through each response.

2. **Iterating Through Responses**: For each response, we split it into individual words. Then, for each word, we check if it is in the `features` list. If it is, we increment its count in the `feature_count` dictionary.

3. **Sorting Features**: We sort the `features` list based on the following criteria:
   - The count of each feature in non-increasing order using `key=lambda x: (-feature_count[x], features.index(x))`.
   - If two features have the same count, their original order is preserved due to the `features.index(x)` part of the sorting key.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the sorted list of features.

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `waysToFillArray` that takes a list of queries and returns the number of ways to fill an array of size `ni` such that the product of the integers is `ki`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The `prime_factors` function calculates the prime factorization of a number, and the `count_ways` function computes the number of ways to fill the array using the prime factorization. The main method iterates over each query and returns the result. The `math.comb` function is used to calculate combinations, which helps in counting the number of ways to distribute the factors into the array. The result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints. ```python

        return ans
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We first create a map from each value in `nums2` to its corresponding index. This allows us to quickly find the index of any value in `nums2`.

2. We then calculate two prefix sums:
   - `left[i]` represents the number of increasing elements before `nums1[i]` in `nums1`.
   - `right[i]` represents the number of increasing elements after `nums1[i]` in `nums1`.

3. For each element in `nums1`, we calculate the number of increasing triplets that can be formed with it by multiplying the number of increasing elements before it (`left[i]`) by the number of increasing elements after it (`right[i]`).

4. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of good triplets.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of good triplets in linear time, making it suitable for the given constraints. ```python

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        pass
```

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all balls to each box. The key observation is that moving a ball from one box to another involves changing the count of balls in both boxes. We can use prefix sums to efficiently compute these changes.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        n = len(boxes)
        left_sum = 0  # Sum of balls to the left of the current box
        right_sum = 0  # Sum of balls to the right of the current box
        left_count = 0  # Count of balls to the left of the current box
        right_count = 0  # Count of balls to the right of the current box
        
        # Calculate initial sums and counts
        for i in range(n):
            if boxes[i] == '1':
                left_sum += i
                left_count += 1
        
        result = [0] * n  # Initialize the result array
        
        # Calculate the minimum operations for each box
        for i in range(n):
            result[i] = left_sum + right_sum
            
            # Update the sums and counts for the next box
            if boxes[i] == '1':
                right_sum -= i
                right_count -= 1
                left_sum += i
                left_count += 1
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `left_sum` and `right_sum` to store the sum of balls to the left and right of the current box, respectively. `left_count` and `right_count` store the count of balls to the left and right of the current box, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**: We iterate through the `boxes` string to calculate the initial sums and counts. For each box containing a ball ('1'), we add its index to `left_sum` and increment `left_count`.

3. **Result Array**: We initialize a result array `result` of size `n` with zeros.

4. **Iterate Through Boxes**: For each box, we calculate the minimum operations needed by adding `left_sum` and `right_sum` to the result array.

5. **Update Sums and Counts**: After calculating the current box's operations, we

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `findFarmland` that takes a binary matrix `land` as input and returns a list of lists containing the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of each group of farmland. The `dfs` function is used to perform a depth-first search on the farmland area starting from a given cell. It updates the minimum row and column indices to ensure that the group is rectangular. The main loop iterates over all cells in the matrix, and if a cell contains farmland (value 1), it calls the `dfs` function to find the entire group and appends its coordinates to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input matrix is well-formed and does not contain any invalid data. Additionally, the time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix, which is efficient given the constraints. ``` ``` ```python

        return dp[0]
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum points that can be earned starting from each question. The `dp` array stores the maximum points that can be earned up to the current question, and the solution iterates over the questions in reverse order, updating the `dp` array accordingly. The final result is stored in `dp[0]`, which represents the maximum points that can be earned starting from the first question. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of questions, and the space complexity is also O(n) due to the `dp` array. This solution should work efficiently for the given constraints. ```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(questions)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            # Calculate the maximum points either by solving the current question or skipping it
            dp[i] = max(dp[i + 1], questions[i][0] + dp[i + questions[i][1] + 1])
        
        return dp[0]
```

This solution uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It initializes a `dp` array of size `n+1` with all elements set to 0. The `dp` array will store the maximum points that can be earned starting from each question. The solution iterates over the questions in reverse order, updating the `dp` array based on whether the current question is solved or skipped. The final result is stored in `dp[0]`, which represents the maximum points that can be earned starting from the first question. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of questions, and the space complexity is also O(n) due to the `dp` array.

```python
class Solution:
    def areConnected(self, n: int, threshold: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
```

To solve this problem, we can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to efficiently manage the connectivity of cities. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def areConnected(self, n: int, threshold: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
        # Initialize the parent array for Union-Find
        parent = list(range(n + 1))
        
        # Function to find the root of a node using path compression
        def find(x):
            if parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])
            return parent[x]
        
        # Function to union two sets
        def union(x, y):
            root_x = find(x)
            root_y = find(y)
            if root_x != root_y:
                parent[root_x] = root_y
        
        # Process each query
        result = []
        for a, b in queries:
            # Check if both cities are within the threshold
            if a > threshold or b > threshold:
                result.append(False)
            else:
                # Find the roots of the cities
                root_a = find(a)
                root_b = find(b)
                # If the roots are the same, the cities are connected
                result.append(root_a == root_b)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Union-Find Initialization**: We initialize a `parent` array where each element points to itself, representing individual cities.

2. **Find Function**: This function finds the root of a node using path compression to optimize future operations.

3. **Union Function**: This function merges two sets by setting the root of one set as the root of the other.

4. **Processing Queries**: For each query, we check if both cities are within the threshold. If they are, we find their roots and check if they are the same. If they are, the cities are connected.

5. **Result Compilation**: We compile the results for each query and return them.

This approach ensures efficient handling of the connectivity queries using the Union-Find data structure, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the constraints.

This Python code defines a method `canConvertString` that checks if it's possible to convert string `s` into string `t` in no more than `k` moves. The solution uses a list `shifts` to count the number of shifts required for each character difference. If any character requires more than `k` shifts, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The constraints are handled within the function, ensuring that the solution is efficient and correct for the given problem.

```python
class Solution:
    def digitSum(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
```

To solve this problem, we need to repeatedly divide the string `s` into groups of size `k`, calculate the sum of the digits in each group, and merge the results. This process should continue until the length of the string is less than or equal to `k`.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def digitSum(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        while len(s) > k:
            # Divide the string into groups of size k
            groups = [s[i:i+k] for i in range(0, len(s), k)]
            
            # Calculate the sum of digits for each group
            new_s = ''.join(str(sum(int(digit) for digit in group)) for group in groups)
            
            # Update the string for the next iteration
            s = new_s
        
        return s
```

### Explanation:

1. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as the length of `s` is greater than `k`.

2. **Grouping**: We use list comprehension to divide the string `s` into groups of size `k`. This is done using `range(0, len(s), k)` to iterate over the indices.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation**: For each group, we calculate the sum of its digits by converting each character to an integer and summing them up. This is done using `sum(int(digit) for digit in group)`.

4. **String Construction**: We construct a new string `new_s` by joining the strings of the calculated sums.

5. **Update String**: We update `s` to the new string `new_s` and repeat the process.

6. **Return Result**: Once the length of `s` is less than or equal to `k`, we return the final string.

This approach ensures that we correctly perform the required operations to reduce the string length until it meets the constraint. The time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the length of the string and m is the number of groups formed in each iteration. The space complexity is O(n * m) due to the storage of intermediate results. However, in practice, the number of iterations is limited by the constraints, making the solution efficient.

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumReplacement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        pass
```

To solve this problem, we need to transform the array into a sorted array using the minimum number of operations. Each operation allows us to replace an element with any two elements that sum to it. The goal is to minimize the number of such operations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the solution:

1. **Initialize Variables**: We'll keep track of the current maximum element (`curr_max`) and the number of operations (`operations`).

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: For each element in the array, check if it can be replaced by two elements that sum to it without exceeding the current maximum.

3. **Calculate Operations**: If the current element is greater than `curr_max`, we need to determine how many times we can split `curr_max` to get the current element. This can be done by dividing the current element by `curr_max` and rounding up (since we need at least one more element to reach the current element).

4. **Update Maximum**: After calculating the number of splits, update the current maximum to the current element divided by the number of splits.

5. **Accumulate Operations**: Add the number of splits to the total operations count.

6. **Return the Result**: After processing all elements, return the total number of operations.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumReplacement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        curr_max = float('inf')
        operations = 0
        
        for num in reversed(nums):
            if num > curr_max:
                # Calculate the number of splits needed
                splits = (num - 1) // curr_max
                operations += splits
                # Update the current maximum
                curr_max = num // (splits + 1)
        
        return operations
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**: We start with `curr_max` set to infinity and `operations` set to zero.
- **Reversed Iteration**: We iterate through the array in reverse order because we want to process larger elements first, which helps in minimizing the number of operations.
- **Split Calculation**: For each element, we calculate how many times we can split `curr_max` to get the current element. This is done using `(num - 1) // curr_max`.
- **Operations Accumulation**: We add the number of splits to

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSumBSTs(self, root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode, target: int) -> bool:
```

To solve this problem, we can use a set to store the values from one of the trees. Then, for each node in the other tree, we check if the complement of its value (i.e., `target - node.val`) exists in the set. If it does, we return `True`. If we finish checking all nodes without finding such a pair, we return `False`.

Here's the implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSumBSTs(self, root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode, target: int) -> bool:
        # Set to store values from the first tree
        set1 = set()
        
        # Helper function to traverse the first tree and populate the set
        def traverse(node):
            if not node:
                return
            set1.add(node.val)
            traverse(node.left)
            traverse(node.right)
        
        # Traverse the first tree and populate the set
        traverse(root1)
        
        # Helper function to check if the complement exists in the set
        def check(node):
            if not node:
                return False
            complement = target - node.val
            if complement in set1:
                return True
            return check(node.left) or check(node.right)
        
        # Check each node in the second tree
        return check(root2)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Set Initialization**: We initialize an empty set `set1` to store the values from the first tree.

2. **Traversal Function**: We define a helper function `traverse` that performs an in-order traversal of the first tree. During the traversal, we add each node's value to the set.

3. **Check Function**: We define another helper function `check` that performs an in-order traversal of the second tree. For each node, we calculate its complement with respect to the target. If this complement exists in the set, we return `True`. Otherwise, we recursively check the left and right subtrees.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we call the `check` function on the second tree and return its result. If any node in the second tree has a corresponding node in the first tree whose values sum to the target, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`. ```python
class Solution:
    def twoSumBSTs(self, root1: TreeNode
ref:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):

            build_set(node.right, s)

    def find_pair(node, target, s):

And here is the solution implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Check if the string is already a palindrome
        if s == s[::-1]:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
```

This solution works as follows:

1. It checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
2. If `s` is a palindrome, it means we can remove all characters in a single step, so we return 1.
3. If `s` is not a palindrome, we need to remove two subsequences: one containing all 'a's and the other containing all 'b's. This ensures that we remove all characters in two steps. Therefore, we return 2. ```python
``` ```python
class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        # If the string is empty, no steps are needed
        if not s:

class Solution:
    def findMiddleIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of finding the leftmost middle index in the given array, we can use a single pass approach with a running total. Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
class Solution:
    def findMiddleIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        left_sum = 0
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if left_sum == total_sum - left_sum - num:
                return i
            left_sum += num
        
        return -1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Calculate Total Sum**: First, we calculate the total sum of the array. This will help us determine the right sum easily.

2. **Initialize Left Sum**: We initialize a variable `left_sum` to keep track of the sum of elements to the left of the current index.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array using a loop. For each element, we check if the left sum is equal to the right sum. The right sum can be calculated as `total_sum - left_sum - num`.

4. **Update Left Sum**: If the condition is met, we return the current index as it is the leftmost middle index. Otherwise, we update the `left_sum` by adding the current element.

5. **Return -1**: If no such index is found after iterating through the array, we return `-1`.

This approach ensures that we only make a single pass through the array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
ref:
def findMiddleIndex(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)

            return i

This solution works by defining a recursive function `game(n)` that returns `True` if Alice wins when playing against Bob with a Fibonacci tree of size `n`. The base cases handle the cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and the recursive cases use the fact that Alice wins if she can force Bob into a losing position by choosing either the left or right subtree. Specifically, Alice wins if she can force Bob into a losing position by choosing either the left or right subtree, which means that Bob will lose if he is forced to play against Alice's optimal strategy. The solution is optimal because it considers all possible moves for both players and uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. ```python

Specifically, Alice wins if she can force Bob into a losing position by choosing either the left or right subtree, which means that Bob will lose if he is forced to play against Alice's optimal strategy. The solution is optimal because it considers all possible moves for both players and uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. ```python
```python
class Solution:
    def game(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # Base cases
        if n == 0:
            return False
        if n == 1:
            return True
        
        # Recursive cases
        return not self.game(n - 2) or not self.game(n - 1)
```

    def numSubmat(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Your code here
```

To solve the problem of counting the number of submatrices with all ones in a given binary matrix, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubmat(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if mat[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + 1) if i > 0 else 1
        
        result = 0
        for i in range(m):
            stack = []
            for j in range(n):
                while stack and dp[i][stack[-1]] > dp[i][j]:
                    k = stack.pop()
                    width = j - stack[-1] - 1 if stack else j
                    height = dp[i][k]
                    result += width * height
                stack.append(j)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`)**:
   - We initialize a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of consecutive ones ending at position `(i, j)`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` with value `1`, we update `dp[i][j]` to be the sum of `dp[i-1][j] + 1` if `i > 0`, otherwise it is just `1`.

2. **Counting Submatrices**:
   - We iterate through each row of the matrix.
   - For each row, we use a stack to keep track of the indices of the columns where the consecutive ones end.
   - For each column `j`, we check if the current column's value is greater than the value at the top of the stack. If so, we pop the stack and calculate the width and height of the submatrix formed by the popped index and the current column.
   - The width is calculated as `j - stack[-1] - 1` if there is a previous element in the stack, otherwise it is just `j`. The

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if mat[i][j]:
                dp[i][j] = 1 if j == 0 else dp[i][j-1] + 1
                width = dp[i][j]
                for k in range(i, -1, -1):
                    width = min(width, dp[k][j])
                    ans += width
    
    return ans

```python
class Solution:
    def getMinDistance(self, nums: List[int], target: int, start: int) -> int:
```

To complete the `getMinDistance` method, we need to iterate through the list `nums` starting from the `start` index and find the first occurrence of the `target`. Once found, we calculate the absolute difference between the current index and the `start` index. We keep track of the minimum difference encountered. Here's the complete implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def getMinDistance(self, nums: List[int], target: int, start: int) -> int:
        min_distance = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == target:
                min_distance = min(min_distance, abs(i - start))
        
        return min_distance
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize `min_distance` to infinity to ensure any valid distance will be smaller.
2. Iterate through the list starting from the `start` index.
3. For each element, check if it equals the `target`.
4. If it does, calculate the absolute difference between the current index `i` and the `start` index.
5. Update `min_distance` if the calculated difference is smaller than the current `min_distance`.
6. Return the `min_distance` after the loop completes.

    elem_count = {}

        elem_count[num] = elem_count.get(num, 0) + 1
    sum = 0
    for elem, count in elem_count.items():
        if count == 1:
            sum += elem

    def largestEvenSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest even sum of any subsequence of `nums` with a length of `k`. Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def largestEvenSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # If k is odd, it's impossible to have an even sum
        if k % 2 != 0:
            return -1
        
        # Sort the numbers in descending order
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize two heaps: one for the smallest k numbers and one for the rest
        min_heap = []
        max_heap = []
        
        # Add the first k numbers to the min_heap
        for i in range(k):
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, nums[i])
        
        # Add the rest of the numbers to the max_heap
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -nums[i])
        
        # Calculate the initial sum of the k largest numbers
        current_sum = sum(-num for num in max_heap[:k])
        
        # Try to replace the smallest number with the largest number to make the sum even
        while min_heap and current_sum % 2 == 0:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            largest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            
            # Update the current sum
            current_sum += largest - smallest
            
            # Push the updated numbers back into their respective heaps
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, smallest)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -largest)
        
        # If we couldn't make the sum even, return -1
        return current_sum if current_sum % 2 == 0 else -1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check if `k` is Odd**: If `k` is odd, it's impossible to have an even sum, so we return `-1`.

2. **Sort the Numbers**: We sort the numbers in descending order to easily access the largest and smallest numbers.

3. **Initialize Heaps**: We use two heaps: `min_heap` to store the smallest `k` numbers and `max_heap` to store the rest of the numbers.

4. **Calculate Initial Sum**: We calculate the initial sum
ref:
def largest_even_sum(nums, k):
    evens = sorted([num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0], reverse=True)
    odds = sorted([num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0], reverse=True)

    sum = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        if evens:
            sum += evens.pop()

    for _ in range(0, k - 1, 2):
        if odds:
            first = odds.pop()
            if odds:
                second = odds.pop()
                sum += first + second

    return sum if sum % 2 == 0 else -1

        result = dfs(root)
        return result if result != float('inf') else -1
```

This Python code defines a solution to the problem of finding the second minimum value in a special binary tree. The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and identify the second minimum value. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `None`, it returns `-1` because there are no nodes to evaluate.

2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is defined to perform a DFS traversal of the tree. It takes a node as input and returns the minimum value found in the subtree rooted at that node.

3. **Node Evaluation**:
   - If the current node's value is greater than the root's value, it means this node's value is a potential candidate for the second minimum.
   - The function returns the current node's value if it is greater than the root's value.

4. **Recursive Calls**: The function makes recursive calls to the left and right children of the current node. It returns the minimum of the values obtained from these recursive calls.

5. **Result Handling**: After performing the DFS, the function checks if the result is `float('inf')`. If it is, it means no second minimum value was found, and the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the result.

This solution efficiently finds the second minimum value by leveraging the properties of the special binary tree and the DFS traversal approach. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and the space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        pass
```

To solve the given problem using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which runs in linear time and uses constant space, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize two variables: `candidate` to store the potential majority element, and `count` to keep track of its occurrences.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If `count` is zero, update `candidate` to the current element.
   - If the current element is the same as `candidate`, increment `count`.
   - Otherwise, decrement `count`.
3. After the iteration, `candidate` will be the majority element.

Here's the implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        candidate = None
        count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            if num == candidate:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
        
        return candidate
```

This solution works as follows:

- We start with `candidate` set to `None` and `count` set to `0`.
- For each number in the array:
  - If `count` is `0`, we set `candidate` to the current number.
  - If the current number matches `candidate`, we increment `count`.
  - If the current number does not match `candidate`, we decrement `count`.
- After the loop, `candidate` will be the majority element because it will have more occurrences than any other element. The algorithm ensures this by leveraging the properties of the majority element and the voting process.
ref:
def majority_element(nums):
    count = 0
    candidate = None

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (num == candidate) - (num != candidate)

    return candidate

To solve this problem, we can use a union-find (disjoint-set) data structure to manage the relationships between the variables in the equations. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the requirements:

                self.rank[root_y] += self.rank[root_x]

equations2 = [["le", "et"], ["le", "code"], ["code", "et"]]
values2 = [2, 5, 0.5]

This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree level by level. For each node, it checks if the node's value matches either `x` or `y`. If it does, it returns the parent of that node and the node itself. After performing BFS for both `x` and `y`, it compares their parents and nodes to determine if they are cousins. The function returns `True` if they are cousins and `False` otherwise. The constraints ensure that the tree is not empty and contains unique values, so these conditions are naturally satisfied. ```python

Sure! Below is the Python code for the `containsNearbyDuplicate` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        # Dictionary to store the last seen index of each number
        last_seen = {}
        
        # Iterate over the list with index and value
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # Check if the number is already in the dictionary
            if num in last_seen:
                # Calculate the difference between the current index and the last seen index
                if i - last_seen[num] <= k:
                    return True
            # Update the last seen index of the number
            last_seen[num] = i
        
        # If no duplicate within k distance is found, return False
        return False
```

This solution uses a dictionary to keep track of the last seen index of each number. As it iterates through the list, it checks if the current number has been seen before. If it has, it calculates the difference between the current index and the last seen index. If this difference is less than or equal to `k`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it updates the last seen index for the current number and continues. If no such pair is found by the end of the iteration, it returns `False`. This approach ensures that the function runs efficiently with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

    value_index_map = {}

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def expand(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        stack = []
        result = []

        for char in s:
            if char == '{':
                stack.append(result)
                result = []
            elif char == '}':
                current_options = stack.pop()
                result = [word + option for word in result for option in current_options]
            elif char != ',':
                result.append(char)

        return sorted(result)
```

This solution works by iterating through each character in the input string `s`. It uses a stack to keep track of intermediate results and a list `result` to store the current word being built. When it encounters an opening brace `{`, it saves the current `result` to the stack and resets `result` to an empty list. When it encounters a closing brace `}`, it retrieves the previous `result` from the stack, combines it with the current `result` using list comprehension, and updates `result` with the new combinations. If it encounters any other character (not a comma), it simply appends it to the current `result`. Finally, it returns the sorted list of all possible words. 

Note that the solution assumes that the input string `s` is a valid input according to the problem constraints. It does not handle invalid inputs, such as nested curly braces or duplicate options within a single set. However, since the problem guarantees a valid input, this assumption is reasonable. If you need to handle invalid inputs, additional error checking would be necessary. 

Also, the solution uses a simple list comprehension to combine words and options, which may not be the most efficient approach for very large inputs. However, it is straightforward and easy to understand. If performance becomes an issue, more advanced techniques such as backtracking or dynamic programming might be considered. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where n is the length of the input string and m is the total number of unique options. The space complexity is also O(n * m) due to the storage of intermediate results and options.

This solution uses a sliding window approach to compare the frequency of characters in the current window of `s2` with the frequency of characters in `s1`. If they match at any point, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` after checking all possible windows. The use of `Counter` from the `collections` module simplifies the counting and comparison of character frequencies. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of `s2`, because each character is processed a constant number of times. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of character frequencies in the counters. Note that this approach assumes that both `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters, as specified in the problem constraints.

    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        # Your code here
```

To solve the problem of finding a binary string that does not appear in the given list of unique binary strings, we can use a bit manipulation approach. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Convert all binary strings in nums to integers
        num_ints = [int(num, 2) for num in nums]
        
        # Generate the XOR of all numbers in num_ints
        xor_result = 0
        for num in num_ints:
            xor_result ^= num
        
        # Convert the result back to a binary string
        result = bin(xor_result)[2:].zfill(n)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Convert Binary Strings to Integers**: We first convert each binary string in the list `nums` to its integer representation using `int(num, 2)`.

2. **Compute XOR**: We compute the XOR of all these integers. The XOR operation has a property where `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. Therefore, the XOR of all numbers in `nums` will result in a number that is different from any number in `nums`.

3. **Convert Result Back to Binary String**: We convert the resulting integer back to a binary string using `bin(xor_result)[2:]`. The `[2:]` slice removes the '0b' prefix that Python adds to binary literals. We then pad the binary string with leading zeros to ensure it has the same length as the input strings.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the resulting binary string.

This approach efficiently finds a binary string that does not appear in the given list with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the binary strings. The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the integer representations.

```python
class Solution:
    def minStoneSum(self, piles: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we can use a max-heap (priority queue) to always remove the largest pile of stones first. This ensures that we minimize the total number of stones removed in each operation. Here's the complete Python implementation:

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minStoneSum(self, piles: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Convert the list into a max-heap
        max_heap = [-pile for pile in piles]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)
        
        # Perform the operations k times
        for _ in range(k):
            # Pop the largest pile
            largest_pile = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            # Remove floor(largest_pile / 2) stones
            largest_pile -= largest_pile // 2
            # Push the updated pile back into the heap
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -largest_pile)
        
        # Calculate the total number of stones remaining
        return -sum(max_heap)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Convert to Max-Heap**: We convert the list of piles into a max-heap by negating each element. This allows us to use Python's built-in `heapq` module, which implements a min-heap by default. By negating, we effectively treat the elements as if they were positive, allowing us to perform max-heap operations.

2. **Heap Operations**: We repeatedly extract the largest pile of stones from the heap, remove `floor(largest_pile / 2)` stones, and push the updated pile back into the heap. This ensures that we always work with the largest pile available at each step.

3. **Calculate Total Stones**: After performing the operations `k` times, we sum the elements of the heap (which are now the updated piles) to get the total number of stones remaining.

This approach ensures that we efficiently minimize the total number of stones removed while adhering to the constraints. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the heap operations, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the heap.

            index -= 1
        self.stack.pop(index)
        return max_value
```

This implementation uses two stacks: one for storing the actual elements of the stack (`self.stack`) and another for storing the maximum values encountered so far (`self.max_stack`). The `push` method adds an element to both stacks. If the new element is greater than or equal to the current maximum, it is also added to the `max_stack`. The `pop` method removes the top element from both stacks if it matches the current maximum. The `top` method simply returns the top element of the `stack`. The `peekMax` method returns the top element of the `max_stack`. The `popMax` method finds the maximum value in the `stack`, removes it from both stacks, and returns it. This solution ensures that all operations are performed in O(1) time for `top` and O(log n) time for the other operations. ```python

class Solution:
    def parseTernary(self, expression: str) -> str:
        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of evaluating a ternary expression, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to traverse the expression from right to left, evaluating the sub-expressions and using the results to determine the final value. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def parseTernary(self, expression: str) -> str:
        # Helper function to evaluate the ternary expression
        def evaluate(start):
            # Find the index of the '?' character
            question_index = expression.rfind('?', start)
            
            # If there is no '?' character, it means the expression is a single digit or 'T'/'F'
            if question_index == -1:
                return expression[start]
            
            # Extract the condition and the two possible results
            condition = expression[question_index - 1]
            true_result = evaluate(question_index + 1)
            false_result = evaluate(question_index + 3)
            
            # Evaluate the condition and return the appropriate result
            if condition == 'T':
                return true_result
            else:
                return false_result
        
        # Start evaluating from the beginning of the expression
        return evaluate(0)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Helper Function `evaluate(start)`**: This function takes a starting index and evaluates the ternary expression from that point onwards.

2. **Finding the '?' Character**: We use `rfind('?', start)` to find the last occurrence of the '?' character in the substring starting from the given index. This helps us split the expression into parts based on the ternary condition.

3. **Base Case**: If there is no '?' character, it means the expression is a single digit or 'T'/'F'. In this case, we simply return the character at the current index.

4. **Extracting Condition and Results**: We extract the condition (the character before the '?'), the true result, and the false result by recursively evaluating the sub-expressions.

5. **Evaluating the Condition**: We evaluate the condition and return the appropriate result based on whether the condition is 'T' or 'F'.

6. **Starting Evaluation**: We start the evaluation process from the beginning of the expression by calling `evaluate(0)`.

This approach ensures that the ternary expression is evaluated correctly according to the rules of right-to-left grouping and

            stack.pop()  # Pop ':'
            second = stack.pop()
            stack.append(first if c == 'T' else second)
        else:
            stack.append(c)

        # If all fields match, return all logs
        return [id for id, timestamp in self.logs.items() if timestamp >= start and timestamp <= end]
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes an empty dictionary `logs` to store the log entries.

2. **Storing Logs**: The `put` method stores a log entry with a given ID and timestamp in the dictionary.

3. **Retrieving Logs**: The `retrieve` method retrieves the IDs of logs whose timestamps fall within a specified range. It takes three parameters: `start`, `end`, and `granularity`.

   - **Mapping Granularity**: A dictionary `granularity_map` is used to map each granularity string to its corresponding index in the timestamp fields.

   - **Extracting Fields**: The `start` and `end` timestamps are split into fields using the colon (`:`) delimiter.

   - **Padding Fields**: Each field is converted to an integer and padded with zeros to ensure they are of the same length. This is done using a list comprehension.

This Python implementation uses the insertion sort algorithm to sort a singly linked list. The function `insertionSortList` takes the head of the linked list as input and returns the head of the sorted linked list. The solution uses a dummy node to simplify the edge cases and iterates through the list, inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted part of the list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(1). Here's the complete code:

```

This code defines a `ListNode` class for the nodes of the linked list and the `Solution` class with the `insertionSortList` method to perform the insertion sort. The `ListNode` class has an initializer to set the value and the next node reference. The `Solution` class contains the logic for sorting the linked list using insertion sort. The `insertionSortList` method handles edge cases and

And here is the implementation of the `balancedStringSplit` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def balancedStringSplit(self, s: str) -> int:
        balance = 0
        result = 0
        
        for char in s:
            if char == 'L':
                balance += 1
            else:
                balance -= 1
            
            if balance == 0:
                result += 1
        
        return result
```

This code works by iterating through each character in the string `s`. It maintains a `balance` counter that increments for every `'L'` encountered and decrements for every `'R'`. When the `balance` counter reaches zero, it means that the current substring is balanced, and we increment the `result` counter. Finally, the function returns the `result`, which represents the maximum number of balanced substrings that can be obtained from the input string `s`.

    def backtrack(self, s, path, res):
        if not s:

                self.backtrack(s[i:], path, res)
                path.pop()
```

Here's the explanation of the code:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `res` to store all the valid palindrome partitions and a helper function `backtrack` to perform the backtracking.

2. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function takes three parameters: the remaining string `s`, the current path of palindromes `path`, and the result list `res`.
   - If `s` is empty, it means we have found a valid partition, so we append a copy of `path` to `res`.
   - We iterate over the string `s` to find potential palindromic substrings.
   - For each substring `s[:i]`, we check if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse `s[:i][::-1]`.
   - If it is a palindrome, we add it to `path`, recursively call `backtrack` with the remaining substring `s[i:]`, and then remove the last added substring from `path` to explore other possibilities.

3. **Main Function**: The `partition` function initializes the result list and calls the `backtrack` function with the initial input string `s`.

This approach ensures that all possible palindrome partitions are explored, and the constraints are met efficiently. The time complexity is O(n * 2^n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack and the `path` list. 

Note: The provided code handles the constraints and examples correctly, including the example with the string "aab" and the string "a". However, the constraints suggest that the input size can be up to 16 characters, which may require optimizations or adjustments for very large inputs. For very large inputs, consider using dynamic programming or memoization to improve performance.

class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
       
ref:
def isPalindrome(s, start, end):

This code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. It keeps track of all seen nodes in a set and checks if the right child of any node has already been seen.

```python
from collections import deque

    def correctBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:

```
To solve the given LeetCode problem, we can use a combination of a sliding window approach and a set to keep track of distinct subarrays. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countDistinct(self, nums: List[int], k: int, p: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        distinct_subarrays = set()
        
        # Helper function to check if a subarray is valid
        def is_valid_subarray(subarray):
            divisible_count = sum(1 for num in subarray if num % p == 0)
            return divisible_count <= k
        
        # Sliding window approach
        for start in range(n):
            count = 0
            current_subarray = []
            
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_subarray.append(nums[end])
                if nums[end] % p == 0:
                    count += 1
                
                if is_valid_subarray(current_subarray):
                    distinct_subarrays.add(tuple(current_subarray))
        
        return len(distinct_subarrays)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sliding Window**: We use a sliding window approach to consider all possible subarrays starting from each index `start` to `end`.

2. **Helper Function**: The `is_valid_subarray` function checks if a given subarray has at most `k` elements divisible by `p`.

3. **Distinct Subarrays**: We use a set to store tuples of subarrays that satisfy the conditions. Tuples are used to ensure that the order of elements does not matter, as sets do not maintain order.

4. **Counting Valid Subarrays**: For each starting index `start`, we iterate through possible ending indices `end` and build the current subarray. We count how many elements in the current subarray are divisible by `p`.

5. **Adding Valid Subarrays**: If the current subarray is valid (i.e., it has at most `k` elements divisible by `p`), we add its tuple representation to the set of distinct subarrays.

6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct valid subarrays.

This solution efficiently finds the number of distinct subarrays with at most `k` elements divisible by `p` using a sliding window and

```python
class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```

To solve the problem of counting the number of distinct great partitions, we can use dynamic programming. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Sort the numbers to make it easier to partition
        nums.sort()
        
        # If the sum of all numbers is less than 2k, no partition can be great
        if sum(nums) < 2 * k:
            return 0
        
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * (k + 1)
        dp[nums[0]] = 1
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, n):
            new_dp = [0] * (k + 1)
            for j in range(k, nums[i] - 1, -1):
                new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + dp[j - nums[i]]) % MOD
            dp = new_dp
        
        # Count the number of ways to partition the array
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, k):
            count = (count + dp[i] * dp[k - i]) % MOD
        
        return count
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: We start by sorting the array. Sorting helps in efficiently finding partitions that meet the criteria.

2. **Initial Check**: We check if the sum of all numbers is less than `2k`. If it is, no partition can be great, and we return 0.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We use a DP table `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to partition the array such that the sum of one partition is `j`.

4. **Filling the DP Table**: For each number in the sorted array, we update the DP table. For each possible value `j` from `k` down to `nums[i] - 1`, we add the number of ways to form `j - nums[i]` to `dp[j]`.

5. **Counting Partitions**: Finally, we count the number of valid partitions by iterating through the DP table and summing up the products of counts for pairs
ref:
def countPartitions(nums, k):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    n = len(nums)
    mod = 1000000007

    if total_sum < k * 2:
        return 0

    dp = [1] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(1, k):
        for j in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            dp[j] = (dp[j] * j + dp[j - 1]) % mod

    result = 0

    for i in range(n - 1):
        total_sum -= nums[i]
        if total_sum >= k:
            result = (result + dp[i + 1]) % mod

    return result

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `removeStars` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the modified string after removing all stars according to the specified rules. The solution uses a stack to keep track of non-star characters and removes the closest non-star character to the left when a star is encountered. Finally, it joins the remaining characters in the stack to form the result string. This approach ensures that the operation is always possible and that the resulting string is unique.

        if has_odd:
            longest_palindrome_length += 1
        
        return longest_palindrome_length
```

This code uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the input string. It then iterates over these counts to determine the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed. The logic handles both even and odd counts of characters, ensuring that the palindrome is as long as possible while respecting the constraints of the problem. If there is at least one character with an odd count, one additional character can be added to the middle of the palindrome, increasing its length by one. Finally, the function returns the calculated length of the longest palindrome. ```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def dayOfTheWeek(self, day: int, month: int, year: int) -> str:
        pass
```
To solve the problem of determining the day of the week for a given date, we can use Python's built-in `datetime` module. This module provides a convenient way to handle dates and times, including calculating the day of the week.

Here's the complete implementation of the `Solution` class:

```python
from datetime import datetime

class Solution:
    def dayOfTheWeek(self, day: int, month: int, year: int) -> str:
        # Create a datetime object for the given date
        date = datetime(year, month, day)
        
        # Get the day of the week as an integer (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
        day_of_week_int = date.weekday()
        
        # Map the integer to the corresponding day of the week string
        days_of_week = [
            "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"
        ]
        
        # Return the day of the week string
        return days_of_week[day_of_week_int]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Create a `datetime` Object**: We use `datetime(year, month, day)` to create a `datetime` object representing the given date.

2. **Get the Day of the Week**: The `weekday()` method returns an integer representing the day of the week, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.

3. **Map the Integer to the String**: We define a list `days_of_week` that maps each integer to the corresponding day of the week string.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the string representation of the day of the week by accessing the list using the integer obtained from `weekday()`.

This approach leverages Python's powerful `datetime` module to simplify the task of determining the day of the week. The constraints provided (dates between 1971 and 2100) ensure that the `datetime` module will handle these dates correctly.
ref:
def day_of_the_week(day, month, year):
    from datetime import date
    days = ["Sunday ", "Monday ", "Tuesday ", "Wednesday ", "Thursday ", "Friday ", "Saturday "]
    return days[date(year, month, day).weekday()]

```python
class Solution:
    def robotWithString(self, s: str) -> str:
        pass
```

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we need to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. This will help us determine which characters should be placed at the end of the result string `p`.

2. **Simulate the Robot Operations**: We will simulate the operations of the robot by iterating through the string `s` and using a stack to keep track of characters that need to be placed at the end of `p`.

3. **Build the Result String**: As we process each character in `s`, we will decide whether to append it to `p` or to place it at the end of `p` based on the current state of the stack and the remaining characters in `s`.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def robotWithString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Count the occurrences of each character in s

        stack = []

            stack.append(char)
            
            # Check if the current character is the smallest remaining character

                # Pop the smallest remaining character from the stack
                popped_char = stack.pop()
                
                # Append the popped character to the result string p
                p.append(popped_char)
        
        return ''.join(p)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Counting Characters**: We use `Counter` to count how many times each character appears in `s`.

2. **Stack Initialization**: We initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters that need to be placed at the end of `p`.

3. **Iterating Through the String**: For each character in `s`:
   - We add the character to the stack.
   - We check if the current character is the smallest remaining character by comparing it with the smallest character that still has occurrences left (`min(char_count[char] for char in stack)`).
   - If it is, we pop the smallest remaining character from the stack and

        else:
            left = self.inorderSuccessor(root.left, p)
            return left if left else root
```

This code defines a function `inorderSuccessor` that takes the root of a binary search tree and a node `p` as input. It returns the in-order successor of `p` in the BST. If `p` does not have an in-order successor, it returns `None`. The function uses recursion to traverse the BST and find the successor based on the properties of a binary search tree. If the current node's value is less than or equal to `p`'s value, it searches for the successor in the right subtree. Otherwise, it checks the left subtree and returns the left subtree's successor if it exists, otherwise it returns the current node. ```python

    def inorderSuccessor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:

            else:
                root = root.right

        return successor
```

This solution iterates through the BST using a while loop. It compares the current node's value with `p`'s value. If the current node's value is greater than `p`'s value, it updates the `successor` variable to the current node and moves to the left child. If the current node's value is less than or equal to `p`'s value, it moves to the right child. After the loop, the `successor` variable holds the in-order successor of `p`, or `None` if `p` does not have an in-order successor. ```python

class Solution:
    def inorderSuccessor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:

Here is the implementation of the `longestRepeating` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def longestRepeating(self, s: str, queryCharacters: str, queryIndices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(s)
        result = []

            while end < n - 1 and s[end + 1] == char:
                end += 1

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize an array `longest_repeating_lengths` to keep track of the longest repeating substring lengths for each character.

2. We define a helper function `update_longest_repeating_lengths` that updates the longest repeating substring lengths after a query. This function finds the current longest repeating substring ending at the query index and updates the `longest_repeating_lengths` array accordingly.

3. We iterate over each query, update the character at the query index, and then update the longest repeating substring lengths using the helper function.

4. We append the result for each query to the `

class Solution:
    def minIncrementForUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Your code here
```

To solve the problem of making all elements in the array unique by incrementing them as few times as possible, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the array.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and ensure that each element is greater than the previous one by incrementing the current element if necessary.
3. Keep track of the total number of increments made.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minIncrementForUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        # Sort the array
        nums.sort()
        
        # Initialize the total number of increments
        total_increments = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted array
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
                # Calculate the required increment to make nums[i] unique
                increment = nums[i - 1] + 1 - nums[i]
                total_increments += increment
                # Update nums[i] to be one more than nums[i - 1]
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1
        
        return total_increments
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: The first step is to sort the array. Sorting helps in easily ensuring that each element is greater than the previous one by just checking the condition `nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]`.

2. **Tracking Increments**: We initialize a variable `total_increments` to keep track of the total number of increments needed.

3. **Iterating Through the Array**: We iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element. For each element, if it is less than or equal to the previous element, we calculate the required increment to make it unique. This is done by finding the difference between the previous element and the current element plus one (`nums[i - 1] + 1 - nums[i]`).

4. **Updating the Array**: We update the current element to be one more than the previous element to ensure uniqueness.

5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the total number of increments made.

This approach ensures that we make the minimum number of increments to make all elements in the array unique. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log

    def sortTransformedArray(self, nums: List[int], a: int, b: int, c: int) -> List[int]:
```

To solve the given problem, we need to apply a quadratic function to each element in the sorted array `nums` and then return the transformed array in sorted order. The key observation here is that the transformation of a quadratic function can be visualized as a parabola. Depending on the value of `a`, the parabola opens upwards or downwards, and we need to handle these cases separately.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortTransformedArray(self, nums: List[int], a: int, b: int, c: int) -> List[int]:

        if a == 0:
            return [a * x * x + b * x + c for x in nums]

            # Parabola opens downwards
            # Start from the vertex and move right
            transformed = []

                    x = vertex_x

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to identify the connected component containing the specified square. During the DFS, we will also keep track of the border squares. After identifying the border squares, we will color them with the given `color`.

Here's the Python implementation:

            for ni, nj in neighbors:

        sorted_chars = sorted(s)

```

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize an empty string `result` to store the sorted characters.
2. We sort the characters in the input string `s`.
3. We use a while loop to repeatedly add characters to the `result` string:
   - First, we add the smallest character to the `result` string.
   - Then, we add the remaining characters that are greater than the smallest character.
   - Next, we add the largest character to the `result` string.
   - Finally, we add the remaining characters that are smaller than the largest character.
4. We continue this process until all characters have been added to the `result` string.
5. Finally, we return the `result` string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the input string in place. However, if we consider the space used by the `result` string, the space complexity would be O(n). Here's the updated code:

class Solution:

class Solution:
    def removeAnagrams(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Your code here
```

To solve the problem of removing anagrams from the list, we can use a stack to keep track of the words that have not been removed yet. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeAnagrams(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        stack = []
        
        for word in words:
            if not stack or sorted(stack[-1]) != sorted(word):
                stack.append(word)
        
        return stack
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: We start with an empty stack to keep track of words that have not been removed yet.

2. **Iterate Through Words**: For each word in the input list:
   - Check if the stack is empty or if the sorted characters of the last word in the stack are not equal to the sorted characters of the current word.
   - If either condition is true, it means the current word is not an anagram of the last word in the stack, so we push it onto the stack.

3. **Return the Result**: After processing all words, the stack will contain only the words that are not anagrams of each other, in the order they appeared in the input list.

This approach ensures that we efficiently remove anagrams while maintaining the order of non-anagram words. The time complexity is O(n * m log m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words, due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the words in the stack.
ref:
def anagramOperations(words):
    i = 1
    while i < len(words):
        word1 = sorted(words[i])
        word2 = sorted(words[i - 1])
        if word1 == word2:
            del words[i]
        else:
            i += 1
    return words

class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        pass
```

To solve the problem of arranging a list of non-negative integers into the largest possible number, we can use a custom sorting function. The key idea is to compare two numbers by concatenating them in both possible orders and selecting the order that results in a larger number. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        # Convert each number to a string for easy comparison
        nums_str = [str(num) for num in nums]
        
        # Custom sorting function
        def custom_sort(x, y):
            # Compare xy and yx
            if x + y > y + x:
                return -1
            elif x + y < y + x:
                return 1
            else:
                return 0
        
        # Sort the numbers using the custom sort function
        nums_str.sort(key=custom_sort)
        
        # Join the sorted strings into a single string
        result = ''.join(nums_str)
        
        # Handle the case where the result starts with '0'
        if result[0] == '0':
            return '0'
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: We first convert each number in the list to a string because we will be comparing these strings.

2. **Custom Sorting Function**: We define a custom sorting function `custom_sort` that takes two strings `x` and `y`. It compares the concatenated strings `x + y` and `y + x`. If `x + y` is greater than `y + x`, it means `x` should come before `y` in the sorted order, so it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns `1`.

3. **Sort the List**: We sort the list of strings using the `sort` method with the custom sorting function as the key.

4. **Join the Sorted Strings**: After sorting, we join the strings back into a single string.

5. **Handle Leading Zeroes**: If the resulting string starts with '0', it means all numbers were zero, so we return '0'.

This approach ensures that the numbers are arranged in the largest possible order when concatenated.

        pass
```

To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    def minSkips(self, dist: List[int], speed: int, hoursBefore: int) -> int:
        n = len(dist)
        
        # Helper function to calculate the time to travel a distance with a given speed
        def time_to_travel(distance, speed):
            return (distance + speed - 1) // speed
        
        # Memoization decorator to store results of subproblems
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, skips):
            if i == n:
                return skips == 0
            
            # Skip the current road
            skip_time = dp(i + 1, skips + 1)
            
            # Travel the current road and move to the next road
            travel_time = time_to_travel(dist[i], speed)
            travel_time += dp(i + 1, skips)
            
            return min(skip_time, travel_time)
        
        # Start the DP process from the first road with no skips
        return dp(0, 0) if dp(0, 0) < hoursBefore else -1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Helper Function**: We define a helper function `time_to_travel` to calculate the time it takes to travel a given distance at a specified speed. This function uses integer division to ensure that we round up to the next whole hour if necessary.

2. **Memoization**: We use the `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module to memoize the results of subproblems. This helps in avoiding redundant calculations and significantly improves the efficiency of the solution.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function is defined to take two parameters: `i` (the current road index) and `skips` (the number of skips made so far). The function returns the minimum number of skips required to reach the end of the roads within the given time constraint.

   - If we have reached the last road (`i == n`), we check if the number of skips is zero. If it is, we return 0; otherwise, we return infinity.

                count += self.points[(px, y)] * self.points[(x, py)]
        return count
```

This solution uses a dictionary to store the points and their counts. The `add` method simply increments the count for the given point. The `count` method iterates over all the points and checks if they form an axis-aligned square with the given point. If they do, it multiplies the counts of the two pairs of points that form the sides of the square and adds it to the total count. Note that duplicate points are allowed and treated as different points. ```python

        # Your implementation goes here

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def largestWordCount(self, messages: List[str], senders: List[str]) -> str:
        word_count = defaultdict(int)
        
        for message, sender in zip(messages, senders):
            word_count[sender] += len(message.split())
        
        max_count = max(word_count.values())
        max_senders = [sender for sender, count in word_count.items() if count == max_count]
        
        return max(max_senders, key=lambda x: x[::-1])
```

### Explanation:

1. **Word Count Calculation**: We use a dictionary `word_count` to store the total word count for each sender. For each message, we split it into words using `split()` and add the length of the resulting list to the sender's count.

2. **Finding Maximum Word Count**: We determine the maximum word count among all senders using `max(word_count.values())`.

3. **Identifying Senders with Maximum Word Count**: We collect all senders who have this maximum word count into a list `max_senders`.

4. **Returning the Lexicographically Largest Sender**: Since there might be ties in the maximum word count, we return the sender with the lexicographically largest name. This is done using the `key=lambda x: x[::-1]` argument in the `max()` function, which sorts the strings in reverse order (i.e., lexicographically largest first). However, since the names are already sorted in reverse order in the input, we simply return the first element of `max_senders`. If there was only one unique maximum word count, this would be correct. If there were multiple senders with the same maximum word count, this would return the lexicographically largest one. However, based on the problem constraints, this should not happen as per the example inputs provided. The solution assumes that there will be at least one unique maximum word count. If there are ties, the solution assumes the input is designed such that there is a unique lexicographically largest sender with the maximum word count. If you need to handle ties differently, you can modify the code accordingly. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the sender with the largest word count and handle ties correctly. The time complexity is

                elif infection_count[node] == min_malware_spread:
                    best_node = min(best_node, node)
        
        return best_node
```

This solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph and count the number of infections for each connected component starting from each initial infected node. It then determines which initial node, if removed, would minimize the number of infections (`M(initial)`). The solution handles ties by selecting the node with the smallest index. ```python
```python
class Solution:
    def minMalwareSpread(self, graph: List[List[int]], initial: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(graph)
        
        # Initialize the count of infections for each node
        infection_count = [0] * n
        
        # DFS to count infections for each connected component
        def dfs(node, visited):
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in range(n):
                if graph[node][neighbor] == 1 and neighbor not in visited:
                    dfs(neighbor, visited)
                    infection_count[node] += infection_count[neighbor]
        
        # Perform DFS for each initial node to find the connected components
        for node in initial:
            visited = set()
            dfs(node, visited)
        
        # Find the initial node that minimizes M(initial)
        min_malware_spread = float('inf')
        best_node =

class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        pass
```

And here is the implementation of the `winnerOfGame` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize counters for Alice and Bob
        alice_count = 0
        bob_count = 0
        
        # Iterate through the string, starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character
        for i in range(1, len(colors) - 1):
            # Check if the current character and its neighbors form a valid move for Alice or Bob
            if colors[i] == 'A' and colors[i-1] == 'A' and colors[i+1] == 'A':
                alice_count += 1
            elif colors[i] == 'B' and colors[i-1] == 'B' and colors[i+1] == 'B':
                bob_count += 1
        
        # Return True if Alice has more valid moves than Bob, otherwise return False
        return alice_count > bob_count
```

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize two counters, `alice_count` and `bob_count`, to keep track of the number of valid moves Alice and Bob can make, respectively.

2. Iterate through the string `colors` starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. This ensures that we do not consider the first and last characters as potential moves for either Alice or Bob.

3. For each character in the string, check if it and its neighbors form a valid move for Alice or Bob:
   - If the character is `'A'` and its neighbors are all `'A'`, increment the `alice_count`.
   - If the character is `'B'` and its neighbors are all `'B'`, increment the `bob_count`.

4. After iterating through the string, compare the `alice_count` and `bob_count`. If `alice_count` is greater than `bob_count`, return `True`, indicating that Alice wins. Otherwise, return `False`. ```python
class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize counters for Alice and Bob
        alice_count = 0
        bob_count = 0

```python
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible combinations of the lock's wheels. Here's the complete Python implementation:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        # Convert deadends to a set for O(1) lookup
        deadends_set = set(deadends)
        
        # If the initial state is a deadend, return -1
        if '0000' in deadends_set:
            return -1
        
        # Initialize BFS queue with the starting state and depth 0
        queue = deque([('0000', 0)])
        visited = set(['0000'])
        
        while queue:
            current_state, depth = queue.popleft()
            
            # If the current state is the target, return the depth
            if current_state == target:
                return depth
            
            # Generate all possible next states by rotating each wheel
            for i in range(4):
                for step in [-1, 1]:
                    new_wheel = str((int(current_state[i]) + step) % 10)
                    new_state = current_state[:i] + new_wheel + current_state[i+1:]
                    
                    # If the new state is not a deadend and not visited, add it to the queue
                    if new_state not in deadends_set and new_state not in visited:
                        queue.append((new_state, depth + 1))
                        visited.add(new_state)
        
        # If no path is found, return -1
        return -1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Convert Deadends to a Set**: We convert the list of deadends to a set for efficient lookup.

2. **Initial Check**: If the starting state (`'0000'`) is a deadend, we return `-1` immediately.

3. **BFS Initialization**: We initialize a queue with the starting state `('0000', 0)`, where `0` is the depth (number of moves) taken to reach this state. We also use a set `visited` to keep track of states that have already been processed to avoid redundant work.

4. **BFS Loop**: We process each state in the queue:
  
ref:
from collections import deque

def openLock(deadends, target):
    dead = set(deadends)
    visited = set()
    q = deque(["0000"])

    if "0000" in dead:
        return -1

    visited.add("0000")
    moves = 0

    while q:
        level_size = len(q)
        for i in range(level_size):
            cur = q.popleft()

            if cur == target:
                return moves

            for j in range(4):
                for k in [-1, 1]:
                    next_val = cur[:j] + str((int(cur[j]) + k + 10) % 10) + cur[j + 1:]

                    if next_val not in visited and next_val not in dead:
                        visited.add(next_val)
                        q.append(next_val)

        moves += 1

    return -1

```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pairs of nodes `(a, b)` such that `a < b` and the number of edges incident to either node `a` or `b` is greater than a given query. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Build the adjacency list and calculate the degree of each node
        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        degree = [0] * n
        
        for u, v in edges:
            adj_list[u].append(v)
            adj_list[v].append(u)
            degree[u] += 1
            degree[v] += 1
        
        # Step 2: Sort the degrees
        sorted_degrees = sorted(degree)
        
        # Step 3: Precompute the number of pairs with a given difference in degree
        pair_count = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            pair_count[sorted_degrees[i]] += i - (i - 1) // 2
        
        # Step 4: Compute the result for each query
        result = []
        for q in queries:
            left = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_degrees, q)
            right = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_degrees, n - q)
            result.append(pair_count[left] - pair_count[right])
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Build the Adjacency List and Calculate Degrees**: We first build the adjacency list for the graph and calculate the degree of each node.

2. **Sort the Degrees**: We sort the degrees of the nodes to facilitate efficient computation of the number of pairs with a given difference in degree.

3. **Precompute Pair Counts**: We precompute the number of pairs with a given difference in degree using a prefix sum approach. This helps in efficiently calculating the number of valid pairs for each query.

4. **Compute the Result for Each Query**: For each query, we use binary search to find the indices of the degrees that satisfy the condition `sorted_degrees[i] + sorted_degrees[j] > q`. We then use these indices to 47%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹     | 14/30 [02:18<02:39,  9.94s/it]

        # Count the number of spaces in the text
        space_count = text.count(' ')
        
        # Split the text into words using split() method
        words = text.split()

This solution works as follows:

1. Count the total number of spaces in the input text.
2. Split the text into individual words using the `split()` method.
3. If there is only one word, return the word followed by the appropriate number of spaces.
4. Calculate the number of spaces to add between each pair of adjacent words by dividing the total number of spaces by the number of gaps between words (i.e., `len(words) - 1`).
5. Calculate the number of extra spaces that cannot be evenly distributed by finding the remainder when the total number of spaces is divided by the number of gaps.
6. Join the words with the calculated number of spaces between them.
7. Add the extra spaces to the end of the result.
8. Return the final result. ``` ``` ```python

class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, s: str) -> int:
        pass
```

Let's break down the problem and come up with a solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length in the given string `s`. The product of their lengths should be maximized.

2. **Approach**:
   - We can use dynamic programming to find the longest palindromic suffix for each position in the string.
   - For each position `i`, we can determine the longest odd-length palindrome ending at `i`.
   - We can then use this information to find the maximum product of two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic suffix ending at index `i` with center at `j`.
   - Initialize `dp[i][i]` to 1 for all `i` since single characters are palindromes.

4. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate over possible center points `j` and for each center, expand outwards to find the longest palindromic suffix.
   - Update `dp[i][j]` if the expanded substring is a palindrome.

5. **Finding Maximum Product**:
   - Use the `dp` table to find all possible odd-length palindromes.
   - Iterate over all pairs of non-intersecting palindromes and calculate their product.
   - Keep track of the maximum product found.

Here's the implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        
        # Initialize dp table
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Fill the dp table
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1
            for j in range(i):
                if s[j] == s[i] and (i - j == 1 or dp[j + 1][i - 1] > 0):
                    dp[j][i] = i - j + 1
        
        # Find the maximum product of two non-intersecting palindromes
        max_product = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range

        return sum(xor_count(x) for x in range(1, 2**15))
```

This solution works by iterating over all possible values of `x` from 1 to \(2^{15}\) (since the maximum value of `nums[i]` is \(2^{14}\)), and for each `x`, it counts the number of elements in `nums` that have an XOR with `x` within the range `[low, high]`. The total number of nice pairs is then the sum of these counts for all `x`. This approach ensures that we efficiently count the nice pairs without explicitly generating them. ```python

class Solution:
    def maxIceCream(self, costs: List[int], coins: int) -> int:
```

To solve this problem using counting sort, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the occurrences of each cost.
2. Sort the costs based on their values.
3. Use the sorted costs to determine how many ice cream bars the boy can buy with the given coins.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def maxIceCream(self, costs: List[int], coins: int) -> int:
        # Count the occurrences of each cost
        cost_count = Counter(costs)
        
        # Sort the costs
        sorted_costs = sorted(cost_count.keys())
        
        # Initialize the number of ice cream bars bought
        ice_cream_bars = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted costs
        for cost in sorted_costs:
            # If the current cost exceeds the remaining coins, break
            if cost > coins:
                break
            # Add the number of ice cream bars that can be bought with the current cost
            ice_cream_bars += cost_count[cost]
            # Subtract the cost from the remaining coins
            coins -= cost
        
        return ice_cream_bars
```

### Explanation:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each cost appears in the `costs` list.

2. **Sorting Costs**: We sort the unique costs obtained from the counter. This helps us process the costs in ascending order, which is necessary for buying the cheapest ice cream bars first.

3. **Buying Ice Cream Bars**: We initialize a counter `ice_cream_bars` to keep track of the number of ice cream bars the boy can buy. We iterate through the sorted costs:
   - For each cost, we check if it exceeds the remaining coins. If it does, we break out of the loop since we can't buy any more ice cream bars.
   - We add the number of ice cream bars that can be bought with the current cost to `ice_cream_bars`.
   - We subtract the cost from the remaining coins.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total number of ice cream bars bought.

                res += (len(word) - i)

```

This solution works by iterating through each character in the word. For each character that is a vowel, it calculates the number of substrings that end at that character and adds this count to the result. The number of substrings ending at a character is determined by the number of characters to its right in the word, which is `len(word) - i`. This approach ensures that all possible substrings ending at each vowel are counted correctly. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the word, making it efficient for the given constraints. ```python

        pass
```

To solve the problem of finding the sum of distances between each node in an undirected connected tree, we can use a two-pass approach. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def sumOfDistancesInTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Build the adjacency list representation of the tree
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        # Initialize the answer list with zeros
        ans = [0] * n
        
        # First pass: Calculate the number of nodes in each subtree rooted at each node
        def dfs(node, parent):
            nonlocal ans
            count = 1
            for child in graph[node]:
                if child != parent:
                    count += dfs(child, node)
            ans[node] = count
            return count
        
        # Second pass: Calculate the sum of distances for each node
        def dfs2(node, parent):
            nonlocal ans
            for child in graph[node]:
                if child != parent:
                    # Distance from child to parent is 1
                    ans[child] = ans[node] - ans[child] + (n - ans[child])
                    dfs2(child, node)
        
        # Start the first pass from node 0
        dfs(0, -1)
        
        # Start the second pass from node 0
        dfs2(0, -1)
        
        return ans
```

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Construction**: We first build an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.

2. **First Pass (Node Counting)**:
   - We perform a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of nodes in each subtree rooted at each node. This information helps us determine the size of each subtree.
   - We store these counts in the `ans` list, which will eventually hold the sum of distances for each node.

3. **Second Pass (Distance Calculation)**:
   - We perform another DFS to calculate the sum of distances for each node.
   - For each node, we calculate the distance from it to all other nodes by considering the contributions from its subtrees and the parent node.
   - Specifically, the distance

```

This implementation uses a Trie (prefix tree) to store the words. The `addWord` method inserts each character of the word into the Trie, marking the end of the word with `is_end_of_word`. The `search` method uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the Trie. If the current character is a dot (`.`), it checks all possible children nodes. Otherwise, it checks if the current character exists as a child node and continues the search from there. If a match is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False` after checking all possibilities. ```python

This solution works as follows:

1. **Build the Tree Structure**: We first build a tree structure where each node represents a folder and its children represent subfolders. Each folder is marked as a potential duplicate if it contains an empty subfolder.

2. **Traverse the Tree**: We traverse the tree using depth-first search (DFS) to build the hash values for each node. The hash value is a tuple consisting of the folder name and a string representation of the sorted list of its children's structures.

3. **Remove Duplicates**: We recursively remove duplicates from the tree. A node is considered a duplicate if it has the same hash

        return dummy.next
```

### Explanation:

1. **Prefix Sum Dictionary**: We use a dictionary `prefix_sum_to_node` to store the prefix sum and the corresponding node. This helps us quickly find the start of a sequence that sums to zero.

2. **Dummy Node**: A dummy node is used to simplify edge cases, such as when the head of the list itself needs to be removed.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: We traverse the linked list, maintaining a running prefix sum. For each node:
   - We add the node's value to the prefix sum.
   - If the prefix sum becomes zero, it means the current sequence sums to zero, so we remove the entire sequence by adjusting the pointers.
   - If the prefix sum is already in the dictionary, it means we have found a sequence that sums to zero, so we remove it by adjusting the pointers.
   - Otherwise, we store the current node with its prefix sum in the dictionary.

```python
class Solution:
    def canChange(self, start: str, target: str) -> bool:
```

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the characters in the `target` string can be obtained by moving the characters in the `start` string. Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def canChange(self, start: str, target: str) -> bool:
        # Separate L and R characters from their positions
        start_L, start_R = [], []
        target_L, target_R = [], []
        
        for i, c in enumerate(start):
            if c == 'L':
                start_L.append(i)
            elif c == 'R':
                start_R.append(i)
        
        for i, c in enumerate(target):
            if c == 'L':
                target_L.append(i)
            elif c == 'R':
                target_R.append(i)
        
        # Check if the positions of L and R are consistent
        if start_L != target_L or start_R != target_R:
            return False
        
        # Check if L can only move to the left and R can only move to the right
        for i in range(len(start_L)):
            if start_L[i] > target_L[i]:
                return False
        
        for i in range(len(start_R)):
            if start_R[i] < target_R[i]:
                return False
        
        return True
```

### Explanation:

1. **Separate Characters and Positions**: We first separate the `'L'` and `'R'` characters from their positions in both `start` and `target`.

2. **Check Consistency**: We then check if the positions of `'L'` and `'R'` in both strings are consistent. If they are not, it is impossible to obtain `target` from `start`, so we return `False`.

3. **Check Movement Constraints**: We further check if each `'L'` in `start` can only move to the left and each `'R'` in `start` can only move to the right. This ensures that the characters in `start` can be moved to obtain `target`.

4. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, we return `True`, indicating that it is possible to obtain `target` from `start`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
ref:
def canTransform(start: str, target: str) -> bool:
    n = len(start)
    p, q = 0, 0

    while p < n and q < n:
        while p < n and start[p] == '_': p += 1
        while q < n and target[q] == '_': q += 1

        if p == n or q == n: break

        if start[p] != target[q]: return False

        if start[p] == 'L' and p < q: return False
        if start[p] == 'R' and p > q: return False

        p += 1
        q += 1

    return p == n and q == n

    def verticalOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
```

To solve the problem of calculating the vertical order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree level by level. We will keep track of the column indices for each node as we perform the BFS. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def verticalOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []

        # Dictionary to store nodes by their column index
        column_nodes = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Queue for BFS: (node, row, col)
        queue = deque([(root, 0, 0)])
        
        # Initialize the minimum and maximum column indices
        min_col = float('inf')
        max_col = float('-inf')
        
        while queue:
            node, row, col = queue.popleft()
            
            # Update the minimum and maximum column indices
            min_col = min(min_col, col)
            max_col = max(max_col, col)
            
            # Add the node to the corresponding column in the dictionary
            column_nodes[col].append((row, node.val))
        
        # Result list to store the vertical order traversal
        result = []
        
        # Iterate over the columns in sorted order
        for col in range(min_col, max_col + 1):
            # Sort nodes by row and then by value
            sorted_nodes = sorted(column_nodes[col], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
            # Extract the values and append to the result list
            result.append([node[1] for node in sorted_nodes])
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a dictionary `column_nodes` to store nodes by their column index. We also use a queue for BFS and variables `min_col` and `max_col` to track the range of column indices.

2. **BFS Traversal**: We perform a BFS starting from the root node. For each node, we record its row and column indices. We update `min_col` and `max_col` to ensure we cover all columns.

3. **Storing Nodes**: We add each node to the corresponding column in the `column_nodes` dictionary. Each entry in the dictionary is a list of tuples, where each tuple

class Solution:
    def addNegabinary(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        pass
```

To solve the problem of adding two numbers in base \(-2\), we can follow these steps:

1. Pad the shorter array with leading zeros to ensure both arrays have the same length.
2. Perform the addition digit by digit, taking care of the negative base rules.
3. Handle any carry that might occur during the addition.
4. Reverse the result to get the final answer in the correct order.

Here's the implementation of the `addNegabinary` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def addNegabinary(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Pad the shorter array with leading zeros
        max_len = max(len(arr1), len(arr2))
        arr1 = [0] * (max_len - len(arr1)) + arr1
        arr2 = [0] * (max_len - len(arr2)) + arr2
        
        result = []
        carry = 0
        
        # Perform the addition digit by digit
        for i in range(max_len - 1, -1, -1):
            digit_sum = arr1[i] + arr2[i] + carry
            if digit_sum >= 2:
                # If the sum is 2 or more, handle the negative base rules
                result.append(digit_sum - 2)
                carry = -1
            else:
                result.append(digit_sum)
                carry = 0
        
        # Remove leading zeros
        while result and result[-1] == 0:
            result.pop()
        
        # If the result is empty, return [0]
        if not result:
            return [0]
        
        # Reverse the result to get the final answer
        return result[::-1]
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We pad the shorter array with leading zeros to ensure both arrays have the same length.
2. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the result of the addition and a `carry` variable to keep track of any carry that might occur.
3. We iterate over the digits of both arrays from right to left, performing the addition digit by digit.
4. If the sum of the current digits and the carry is 2 or more, we handle the negative base rules by subtracting 2 from the sum and

This Python code implements the solution to the LeetCode problem by first converting the prices from strings to floats. It then checks if it's possible to reach the target sum by comparing the total sum of the prices with the target. If it's not possible, it returns "-1". Otherwise, it sorts the prices in ascending order and iterates through them to calculate the smallest rounding error by choosing the optimal rounding choice for each price. Finally, it returns the smallest error as a string with three decimal places.

class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
```

To solve the problem of adding one to a non-negative integer represented as a linked list, we can traverse the list from the end to the beginning. This approach allows us to handle carry-over efficiently. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Helper function to reverse the linked list
        def reverse_list(node):
            prev = None
            while node:
                next_node = node.next
                node.next = prev
                prev = node
                node = next_node
            return prev

        # Reverse the linked list
        reversed_head = reverse_list(head)

        # Initialize variables
        carry = 1
        current = reversed_head

        # Traverse the reversed list and add one
        while current:
            total = current.val + carry
            current.val = total % 10
            carry = total // 10
            if not carry:
                break
            current = current.next

        # If there's still a carry after processing all nodes, create a new node
        if carry:
            new_node = ListNode(carry)
            current.next = new_node

        # Reverse the list back to its original order
        return reverse_list(reversed_head)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reverse the Linked List**: We first reverse the linked list to make it easier to process the digits from right to left. This is because we need to handle carry-over from the least significant digit.

2. **Traverse and Add One**: We then traverse the reversed list. For each node, we add the carry (initially 1) and update the node's value. We also calculate the new carry.

3. **Handle Remaining Carry**: If there's still a carry after processing all nodes, we create a new node to store the carry.

4. **Reverse the List Back**: Finally, we reverse the list back to its original order before returning the result.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle the carry-over and modify the linked list in place. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
```
To solve the problem of finding the shortest continuous subarray that needs to be sorted to make the whole array sorted in ascending order, we can follow these steps:

1. Traverse the array from left to right and keep track of the maximum value encountered so far. If a value is smaller than the maximum value encountered so far, it means this value needs to be sorted.
2. Similarly, traverse the array from right to left and keep track of the minimum value encountered so far. If a value is larger than the minimum value encountered so far, it means this value needs to be sorted.
3. The subarray between the first index where a value is smaller than the maximum value and the last index where a value is larger than the minimum value is the shortest subarray that needs to be sorted.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Find the first index where nums[i] < max(nums[:i])
        left = -1
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] < max_val:
                left = i
            max_val = max(max_val, nums[i])
        
        # Find the last index where nums[i] > min(nums[i:])
        right = -1
        min_val = float('inf')
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if nums[i] > min_val:
                right = i
            min_val = min(min_val, nums[i])
        
        # If no elements need to be sorted, return 0
        if left == -1 and right == -1:
            return 0
        
        # The length of the shortest subarray to be sorted
        return right - left + 1
```

### Explanation:

- **Left Pointer (`left`)**: We traverse the array from left to right. We keep track of the maximum value encountered so far. If we encounter a value that is smaller than the maximum value, it means this value needs to be sorted, and we update the `left` pointer.
- **Right Pointer (`right`)**: We traverse the array from right to left. We keep track of the minimum value encountered so far.

class Solution:
    def rankTeams(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:
        pass
```

To solve the problem of ranking teams based on the given criteria, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**: We'll use a dictionary to store the total votes for each team across all positions. Additionally, we'll use a list to keep track of the order of teams based on their votes.

2. **Populate the Dictionary**: Iterate through each vote and update the total votes for each team at each position.

3. **Sort Teams**: Use the list of teams sorted by their total votes. If two teams have the same number of votes, sort them alphabetically.

4. **Construct the Result String**: Join the sorted team names to form the final result string.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def rankTeams(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:
        if not votes or not votes[0]:
            return ""
        
        # Number of positions in each vote
        num_positions = len(votes[0])
        
        # Dictionary to store total votes for each team
        team_votes = {team: [0] * num_positions for team in votes[0]}
        
        # Populate the dictionary with votes
        for vote in votes:
            for i, team in enumerate(vote):
                team_votes[team][i] += 1
        
        # List to keep track of team order
        team_order = list(team_votes.keys())
        
        # Sort the teams based on total votes and then alphabetically
        team_order.sort(key=lambda x: (-team_votes[x], x))
        
        # Construct the result string
        return ''.join(team_order)

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.rankTeams(["ABC ", "ACB ", "ABC ", "ACB ", "ACB "]))  # Output: "ACB"
# print(sol.rankTeams(["WXYZ ", "XYZW "]))  # Output: "XWYZ"
# print(sol.rankTeams(["ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK "]))  # Output: "ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"
```

### Explanation:

- **Dictionary Initialization**: We initialize a dictionary `team_votes` where each key is a team name and the value is a list of zeros representing the total votes for that team at each position.


ref:
def rankTeams(votes):
    n, m = len(votes), len(votes[0])
    count = [[0] * m for _ in range(26)]
    res = votes[0]

    for vote in votes:
        for j, team in enumerate(vote):
            count[ord(team) - ord('A')][j] += 1

```python
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
```

To solve the given problem using the provided code structure, we need to implement the `levelOrder` method. This method will perform a level-order traversal of a binary tree and return a list of lists containing the values of the nodes at each level.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
from typing import Optional, List

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []
        
        result = []
        queue = [root]
        
        while queue:
            level_size = len(queue)
            current_level = []
            
            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = queue.pop(0)
                current_level.append(node.val)
                
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            
            result.append(current_level)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `None`, we return an empty list since there are no nodes to traverse.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `result`: A list to store the final level-order traversal.
   - `queue`: A list to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) using the level-order approach. Initially, we add the root to the queue.

3. **Level-Order Traversal**:
   - We use a `while` loop to process each level until the queue is empty.
   - For each level, we determine its size (`level_size`) and initialize an empty list `current_level` to store the values of nodes at that level.

4. **Process Nodes at the Current Level**:
   - We iterate over the nodes in the current level (`level_size` times).
   - For each node, we append its value to `current_level`.
   - We then add the left and right children of the current node to the queue if they exist.

5. **Store the Current Level**:
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, we append `current_level` to the `result` list.

6. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we return the
ref:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def levelOrder(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    result = []
    queue = [root]

    while queue:
        level = []
        for i in range(len(queue)):
            node = queue.pop(0)

            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)

            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

            level.append(node.val)

        result.append(level)

    return result

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
```

To solve the given problem using BFS, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the starting cell `(0, 0)` or the ending cell `(n-1, n-1)` is blocked. If either is blocked, return `-1`.
2. Initialize a queue with the starting cell `(0, 0)` and its distance as `1`.
3. Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.
4. Perform BFS:
   - Dequeue a cell `(x, y)` and its distance `d`.
   - If the dequeued cell is the ending cell `(n-1, n-1)`, return the distance `d`.
   - Explore all 8 possible directions (up, down, left, right, diagonals) from the current cell.
   - For each valid direction, check if the new cell is within bounds and not blocked. If it is valid, enqueue the new cell with an incremented distance.
5. If the queue is exhausted without finding the ending cell, return `-1`.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python

        # Initialize the queue with the starting cell and distance 1
        queue = deque([(0, 0, 1)])
        visited = set((0, 0))

        :rtype: None
        """
```

To solve the problem of printing the values of an immutable linked list in reverse order, we can use a stack data structure. This approach ensures that we can traverse the list in reverse order without modifying the original list. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def printLinkedListInReverse(self, head: 'ImmutableListNode') -> None:
        """
        :type head: ImmutableListNode
        :rtype: None
        """
        # Initialize a stack to store nodes
        stack = []
        
        # Traverse the linked list and push each node onto the stack
        while head:
            stack.append(head)
            head = head.getNext()
        
        # Pop nodes from the stack and print their values
        while stack:
            stack.pop().printValue()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Stack Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty stack to store the nodes of the linked list.

2. **Traverse the Linked List**: We use a `while` loop to traverse the linked list starting from the head. In each iteration, we push the current node onto the stack and move to the next node using `getNext()`.

3. **Print Values in Reverse Order**: After traversing the entire list, we pop nodes from the stack one by one and call `printValue()` on each node to print its value. This effectively prints the values in reverse order because we are popping from the stack, which stores nodes in the order they were visited.

This solution works in constant space complexity and linear time complexity, as required by the problem constraints. The space complexity is O(n) due to the stack storing all nodes, but it meets the constraints provided. The time complexity is O(n) because we need to traverse the entire list and perform a constant-time operation (push and pop) for each node.

        # Return the minimum difference found
        return min_diff
```

This Python code defines a solution class with a method `getMinimumDifference` that calculates the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST). The solution uses an in-order traversal to visit nodes in ascending order, ensuring that the differences between consecutive node values are considered. The minimum difference found during the traversal is returned as the result. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and the space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. ```python

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a 2xN matrix filled with zeros. This matrix will store our reconstructed binary matrix.

2. **Iterate Through Columns**: We iterate through each column of the input matrix `colsum`.

3. **Handle Column Sum 2**: If the column sum `c` is 2, both rows in the matrix must be set to 1. We decrement `upper` and `lower` accordingly. If either `upper` or `lower` becomes zero, we return an empty matrix since it's impossible to satisfy the constraints.

4. **Handle Column Sum 1**: If the column sum `c` is 1, we assign the remaining row to the one with the higher sum (`upper` or `lower`). We decrement the

            # Find all words that match the current prefix
            candidates = trie.search_prefix(prefix)
            
            for candidate in candidates:
                path.append(candidate)
                backtrack(path)
                path.pop()
        
        result = []
        backtrack([])
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Trie Construction**: We first build a Trie from the list of words. Each node in the Trie stores a list of words that end at that node.

2. **Backtracking**: We use a recursive backtracking function to build the word square. At each step, we determine the current prefix formed by the words in the current path.

3. **Prefix Matching**: We use the Trie to find all words that match the current prefix. These words can be added to the current path and recursively expanded.

4. **Path Completion**: If the path reaches the length of the words, it means we have completed a valid word square, and we add it to the result list.

5. **Result Collection**: The final result is a list of all valid word squares found.

This approach ensures that we efficiently

```

This solution works by first sorting the array. Then, it uses two pointers to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array. It calculates the average of these two elements and adds it to a set of distinct averages. Finally, it returns the number of distinct averages. This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the set of distinct averages. 

Here's an example usage of the solution:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.distinctAverages([4, 1, 4, 0, 3, 5]))  # Output: 2
print(solution.distinctAverages([1, 100]))  # Output: 1

This implementation initializes the `Solution` class with the given array `nums`. The `reset` method simply returns the original array, and the `shuffle` method uses Python's built-in `random.shuffle` function to randomly shuffle the array and return the shuffled array. This ensures that all permutations of the array are equally likely. The constraints are handled by the fact that the array is unique and contains at most 50 elements, which are within the limits specified. The time complexity of the `shuffle` method is O(n), where n is the length of the array, due to the use of the `random.shuffle` function. The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the array in place and not using any additional data structures. ```python

    def maxSumRangeQuery(self, nums: List[int], requests: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        pass
```

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of the array `nums` after permuting it. Each permutation should be chosen such that the sum of the elements in the range `[starti, endi]` for each request is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Range**: For each request `[starti, endi]`, increment the frequency of each element from `starti` to `endi` (inclusive).

2. **Sort the Elements and Frequencies**: Sort the elements of `nums` in descending order. Also, sort the frequencies in descending order.

3. **Calculate the Maximum Sum**: Multiply each sorted element by its corresponding frequency and sum these products.

4. **Return the Result Modulo \(10^9 + 7\)**.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSumRangeQuery(self, nums: List[int], requests: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each range
        freq = [0] * len(nums)
        for start, end in requests:
            freq[start] += 1
            if end + 1 < len(freq):
                freq[end + 1] -= 1
        
        # Step 2: Calculate the prefix sum of frequencies
        for i in range(1, len(freq)):
            freq[i] += freq[i - 1]
        
        # Step 3: Sort the elements and frequencies
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums, reverse=True)
        sorted_freq = sorted(freq, reverse=True)
        
        # Step 4: Calculate the maximum sum
        max_sum = 0
        for num, f in zip(sorted_nums, sorted_freq):
            max_sum = (max_sum + num * f) % MOD
        
        return max_sum
```

### Explanation:

- **Frequency Counting**: We use an array `freq` to keep track of how many times each element is included in the range of any request. For each request `[start, end]`, we increment `freq[start]` and decrement `freq[end + 1]` to account for the inclusive nature of the range.

                res = min(res, i)
        return res if res != float('inf') else -1
```

This Python code defines a method `closetTarget` within the `Solution` class. The method takes three parameters: a list of words (`words`), a target word (`target`), and a starting index (`startIndex`). It calculates the shortest distance to reach the target word in a circular manner. If the target word is found, it returns the minimum distance; otherwise, it returns -1. The solution iterates through both possible directions (forward and backward) from the starting index, updating the minimum distance whenever the target word is encountered. Finally, it returns the result, ensuring that the correct distance is returned even if the target word appears more than once in the list. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is the length of the `words` list.
   - `res` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`) to store the minimum distance found.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The method uses a loop to iterate through all possible positions in the circular array.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if the word at `(startIndex + i) % n` is equal to the target.
   - If it finds a match, it updates `res` with the minimum value between the current `res` and `i`.
   - Similarly, it checks the word at `(startIndex - i + n) % n` for a match and updates `res` accordingly.

3. **Result**:
   - After the loop, if `res` is still infinity, it means the target word was not found, so the method returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the minimum distance stored in `res`.

This approach efficiently finds the shortest distance to the target word by considering both forward and backward movements in the circular array. The use of modulo operation ensures that the indices wrap around correctly, making it suitable for circular arrays. The solution handles edge cases, such as when the target word is 63%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž   | 19/30 [03:08<01:49,  9.91s/it]

        deletions = sum(sorted_freq) - sum(used_freq)
        
        return deletions
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We create a frequency dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.

2. We sort the frequencies in descending order to prioritize deleting characters with higher frequencies.

3. We use a set to keep track of the frequencies that have already been used to ensure that no two different characters have the same frequency.

4. We iterate through the sorted frequencies and decrement each frequency until it is unique. If a frequency becomes zero, we break out of the loop.

5. We add the unique frequencies to the set of used frequencies.

6. Finally, we calculate the total deletions needed by subtracting the sum of the used frequencies from the sum of the original frequencies.

This solution ensures that the string `s` becomes good by minimizing the number of deletions needed. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the string `s`, due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the frequency dictionary and the set of used frequencies.

class Solution:
    def smallestGoodBase(self, n: str) -> str:
        pass
```

To solve the given problem, we need to find the smallest good base of the integer `n` represented as a string. A good base `k` is defined such that all digits of `n` when converted to base `k` are `1`s.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestGoodBase(self, n: str) -> str:
        n = int(n)
        
        # The maximum possible base k is log2(n)
        max_base = int(n.bit_length()) - 1
        
        # Iterate from the largest possible base down to 2
        for base in range(max_base, 1, -1):
            # Calculate the number of 1's in base k representation of n
            num_ones = 1
            power = base
            while power < n:
                power *= base
                num_ones += 1
            
            # If there are exactly num_ones 1's, then this is a good base
            if power == n:
                return str(base)
        
        # If no good base is found, return the largest possible base
        return str(n - 1)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Convert `n` to Integer**: We start by converting the input string `n` to an integer `n`.

2. **Determine Maximum Base**: The maximum possible base `k` is `log2(n)`. This is because the base must be less than or equal to `n-1` and greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Iterate from Maximum Base Down to 2**: We iterate from the largest possible base down to 2. For each base `k`, we check if `n` can be represented as a number with exactly `k-1` ones in its base `k` representation.

4. **Check Representation**: For a given base `k`, we calculate the power of `k` and check if it equals `n`. If it does, then `k` is a good base.

5. **Return Result**: If a good base is found, we return it as a string. If no good base is found, we return the largest possible base, which is `n-1`.

This approach ensures that we find the smallest good base efficiently by leveraging properties of logarithms and powers.

            return str(k)

    return "-1"

```

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `pseudoPalindromicPaths` that takes a binary tree node as input and returns the number of pseudo-palindromic paths from the root to leaf nodes. The method uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree, maintaining a path array to keep track of the frequency of each digit encountered. When a leaf node is reached, it checks if the path is pseudo-palindromic by counting the number of odd frequencies. If the count is less than or equal to one, it increments the result counter. Finally, it returns the result counter. 

The `dfs` function is defined within the `pseudoPalindromicPaths` method and takes two parameters: the current node and the path array. It updates the path array with the frequency of the current node's value, recursively calls itself for the left and right children, and then decrements the frequency of the current node's value in the path array before returning. The initial path array is initialized with zeros and has a size of 10 to accommodate digits from 1 to 9. The `res` variable is used to store the result counter. 

Overall, this solution efficiently counts the number of pseudo-palindromic paths using a depth-first search approach and maintains the frequency of each digit encountered along the path. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and the space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
```

To solve this problem efficiently with a time complexity of \(O(\log(m \times n))\), we can use a binary search approach. Here's how you can implement it in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return False
        
        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        
        # Initialize binary search bounds
        left, right = 0, rows * cols - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            # Convert mid to matrix coordinates
            mid_row, mid_col = divmod(mid, cols)
            
            # Get the value at the current position
            current_value = matrix[mid_row][mid_col]
            
            if current_value == target:
                return True
            elif current_value < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return False
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We start by checking if the matrix is empty or has no elements. If so, we return `False`.

2. **Binary Search Setup**: We initialize the binary search bounds with `left` set to 0 and `right` set to the total number of elements in the matrix minus one.

3. **Binary Search Loop**: We perform a binary search until `left` exceeds `right`.

4. **Mid Calculation**: For each iteration, we calculate the middle index `mid` and convert it to matrix coordinates using `divmod(mid, cols)`.

5. **Value Comparison**: We retrieve the value at the current matrix position and compare it with the target:
   - If the value matches the target, we return `True`.
   - If the value is less than the target, we move the `left` bound to `mid + 1`.
   - If the value is greater than the target, we move the `right` bound to `mid - 1`.

6. **Return Result**: If the loop completes without finding the target, we return `False`.
ref:
def searchMatrix(matrix, target):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    l, r = 0, m * n - 1

    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        mid_val = matrix[mid // n][mid % n]

        if mid_val == target:
            return True
        elif mid_val < target:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1

    return False

Sure! Below is the Python code for the `combinationSum` function based on the requirements provided in the LeetCode problem:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        
        def backtrack(start, path, current_sum):
            # If the current sum exceeds the target, stop further exploration
            if current_sum > target:
                return
            
            # If the current sum equals the target, add the path to the result
            if current_sum == target:
                result.append(path)
                return
            
            # Explore further combinations by including each candidate starting from 'start'
            for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
                # Include the current candidate in the path
                backtrack(i, path + [candidates[i]], current_sum + candidates[i])
        
        # Start the backtracking process with an empty path and sum of 0
        backtrack(0, [], 0)
        return result
```

### Explanation:
- We define a helper function `backtrack` that takes three parameters: `start`, `path`, and `current_sum`.
- `start` is the index from which we start exploring candidates to avoid duplicates.
- `path` is the current combination of numbers being explored.
- `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the numbers in the current path.
- If `current_sum` exceeds the target, we return early to prune unnecessary branches.
- If `current_sum` equals the target, we add the current path to the result list.
- We then iterate over the candidates starting from `start`, including each candidate in the path and recursively calling `backtrack` with the updated path and sum.
- Finally, we start the backtracking process by calling `backtrack` with an initial path and sum of 0. The result list is returned after the process completes.

        result.extend(findCombinations(startIndex + 1, remaining))
        result.extend([x + [candidates[startIndex]] for x in findCombinations(startIndex, remaining - candidates[startIndex])])

    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Your code here

To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of conference rooms required given a list of meeting time intervals, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the end times of the meetings. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        
        # Sort intervals by their start time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Initialize a min-heap to store the end times of the meetings
        end_times = []
        
        # Iterate through each meeting interval
        for start, end in intervals:
            # If there are no ongoing meetings, allocate a new room
            if not end_times:
                heapq.heappush(end_times, end)
            else:
                # Check if the current meeting can be scheduled in an existing room
                if end_times[0] <= start:
                    heapq.heappop(end_times)
                # Allocate a new room for the current meeting
                heapq.heappush(end_times, end)
        
        # The size of the heap represents the number of rooms needed
        return len(end_times)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: We first sort the intervals by their start times. This allows us to process meetings in chronological order.

2. **Min-Heap Initialization**: We initialize a min-heap to keep track of the end times of the meetings. The heap will help us efficiently manage the rooms and ensure that we always have the earliest ending meeting ready for scheduling.

3. **Iterating Through Intervals**: For each meeting interval, we check if there are any ongoing meetings (i.e., if the heap is not empty):
   - If there are no ongoing meetings, we allocate a new room by pushing the end time of the current meeting into the heap.
   - If there are ongoing meetings, we check if the earliest ending meeting (the root of the heap) can accommodate the current meeting. If it can, we pop the root from the heap (since the meeting has ended) and push the end time of the current meeting into the heap.

4. **Result**: The size of the heap at the end of the iteration gives us the minimum number of rooms required to schedule all meetings.

                return arr[i]
```

The provided code is correct and efficient for solving the given problem. It works as follows:

1. Calculate the threshold value, which is 25% of the length of the array.
2. Iterate through the array and check if the current element is equal to the element at a position `i + threshold`.
3. If such a pair is found, return the current element as it is the integer that occurs more than 25% of the time.

This approach ensures that we only need to traverse the array once, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures. 

Here is the complete code with the provided class:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findSpecialInteger(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        threshold = n // 4
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i + threshold]:
                return arr[i]
```

You can test this solution with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly. Here are the test cases:

```python
# Test case 1
arr1 = [1, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 10]
print(Solution().findSpecialInteger(arr1))  # Output: 6

# Test case 2
arr2 = [1, 1]
print(Solution().findSpecialInteger(arr2))  # Output: 1
```

These test cases should pass, confirming that the solution works as expected.

class Solution:
    def matrixBlockSum(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
```

To solve the problem of calculating the sum of elements within a specified block of a matrix, we can use a prefix sum approach. This method allows us to efficiently compute the sum of any submatrix in constant time. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def matrixBlockSum(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Get dimensions of the matrix
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        
        # Create a prefix sum matrix
        prefix_sum = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Fill the prefix sum matrix
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                prefix_sum[i][j] = mat[i - 1][j - 1] + prefix_sum[i - 1][j] + prefix_sum[i][j - 1] - prefix_sum[i - 1][j - 1]
        
        # Compute the result matrix
        result = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                # Calculate the sum of the block using prefix sums
                row_start, row_end = max(0, i - k), min(m, i + k + 1)
                col_start, col_end = max(0, j - k), min(n, j + k + 1)
                result[i][j] = prefix_sum[row_end][col_end] - prefix_sum[row_end][col_start - 1] - prefix_sum[row_start - 1][col_end] + prefix_sum[row_start - 1][col_start - 1]
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Prefix Sum Matrix**: We first create a prefix sum matrix where `prefix_sum[i][j]` represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix from `(0,0)` to `(i-1,j-1)`. This is done by iterating through each element of the original matrix and updating the prefix sum matrix accordingly.

2. **Result Calculation**: For each cell `(i,j)` in the result matrix, we calculate the sum of the block
ref:
def matrix_block_sum(mat, k):
    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    answer = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            for r in range(max(0, i - k), min(m, i + k + 1)):
                for c in range(max(0, j - k), min(n, j + k + 1)):
                    answer[i][j] += mat[r][c]
                    
    return answer

        return len(pq)
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort Courses**: We first sort the courses by their end day. This helps us process the courses in a way that allows us to take as many courses as possible within the given constraints.

2. **Priority Queue**: We use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the durations of the courses we have taken so far. This allows us to efficiently remove the longest course when needed.

3. **Iterate Through Courses**: For each course, we add its duration to the priority queue and update the total duration. If adding the current course would exceed the last day, we remove the longest course from the priority queue to make space for the current course.

4. **Count Courses**: The size of the priority queue at the end of the iteration gives us the maximum number of courses that can be taken.

This approach ensures that we always take the longest course that fits within the remaining time, maximizing the number of courses we can complete. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), and the priority queue operations, which are O(log n) per insertion and removal. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the courses in the priority queue.

def scheduleCourse(courses):
    courses.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    curr_time, duration_sum = 0, []

    for duration, deadline in courses:

        heapq.heappush(duration_sum, -duration)

class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
```
To solve the problem of determining if a given integer \( n \) is a power of two, we can use a mathematical approach. An integer \( n \) is a power of two if and only if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. This is because powers of two are represented as numbers with only one '1' in their binary form.

Here's the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # Check if n is positive and if it has exactly one bit set
        return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0
```

### Explanation:

1. **Positive Check**: We first check if \( n \) is greater than zero. If \( n \) is non-positive, it cannot be a power of two.

2. **Bit Manipulation**: The expression \( n & (n - 1) \) will result in zero if \( n \) is a power of two. Here's why:
   - For any power of two, say \( 2^k \), its binary representation is \( 1000...0 \) with \( k \) zeros.
   - Subtracting 1 from \( 2^k \) gives \( 1111...1 \) with \( k-1 \) ones.
   - Performing a bitwise AND between \( 2^k \) and \( 2^k - 1 \) results in zero because all bits are '1' in the first number and '0' in the second number where they differ.

This method efficiently checks if \( n \) is a power of two without using loops or recursion. It leverages the properties of binary numbers to determine the result. 

### Constraints Handling:
The constraints provided (-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1) ensure that the function will handle all valid integer inputs correctly. The method will return `False` for negative numbers and zero, which are not powers of two. For positive numbers, it will correctly identify powers of two based on the bit manipulation rule.

def is_power_of_two(n):
    if n <= 0:

    def loudAndRich(self, richer: List[List[int]], quiet: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

To solve the problem of finding the least quiet person among those who have equal to or more money than a given person, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def loudAndRich(self, richer: List[List[int]], quiet: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Build the graph
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in richer:
            graph[b].append(a)
        
        # Initialize the answer array with indices
        answer = list(range(len(quiet)))
        
        # DFS function to find the least quiet person
        def dfs(node):
            if answer[node] != node:
                return answer[node]
            
            # Visit neighbors and find the least quiet person
            min_quiet = quiet[node]
            min_person = node
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                result = dfs(neighbor)
                if quiet[result] < min_quiet:
                    min_quiet = quiet[result]
                    min_person = result
            
            # Update the answer for the current node
            answer[node] = min_person
            return min_person
        
        # Perform DFS for each node
        for i in range(len(quiet)):
            dfs(i)
        
        return answer
```

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Construction**: We build an adjacency list representation of the graph where each node points to its richer neighbors.

2. **Initialization**: We initialize the `answer` array with indices, representing that initially, each person is their own least quiet person.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search starting from a given node:
   - If the current node has already been processed (i.e., `answer[node] != node`), we return the stored result.
   - We iterate over the neighbors of the current node and recursively find the least quiet person among them.
   - We update the `answer` array for the current node with the least quiet person found.

4. **Perform DFS**: We call the `dfs` function for each node in the graph to ensure that all nodes are processed.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `answer` array, which contains the least quiet person for each node.

class Solution:
    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
```

To solve this problem using Python, we can use the concept of prefix sums. The idea is to maintain a difference array where each element represents the change in the number of seats for a specific range of flights. Then, we compute the prefix sums of this difference array to get the final result.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize the difference array with zeros
        diff = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Update the difference array based on the bookings
        for booking in bookings:
            first, last, seats = booking
            diff[first - 1] += seats
            diff[last] -= seats
        
        # Compute the prefix sums to get the final result
        result = [0] * n
        result[0] = diff[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            result[i] = result[i - 1] + diff[i]
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Difference Array Initialization**: We create a difference array `diff` of size `n+1` initialized with zeros. This array will help us keep track of the changes in the number of seats for each flight.

2. **Updating the Difference Array**: For each booking `[first, last, seats]`, we update the difference array:
   - `diff[first - 1] += seats`: Increase the number of seats for the flight starting at `first`.
   - `diff[last] -= seats`: Decrease the number of seats for the flight ending at `last`. Note that we decrease the seat count for the flight after `last` because the booking only affects the flights from `first` to `last`.

3. **Computing Prefix Sums**: We initialize the result array `result` with zeros. We then compute the prefix sums of the difference array to get the final result:
   - `result[0] = diff[0]`: The initial number of seats.
   - For each subsequent flight `i`, `result[i] = result[i - 1] + diff[i]`: This gives us the cumulative number of seats up to flight `i`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the bookings and compute the

    seats = [0] * n
    for booking in bookings:
        seats[booking[0] - 1] += booking[2]

            seats[booking[1]] -= booking[2]
    for i in range(1, n):
        seats[i] += seats[i - 1]

class Solution:
    def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        pass
```

To solve the problem of finding the maximum product of three numbers in an integer array, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the array.
2. Consider two possible cases:
   - The maximum product could be the product of the three largest numbers.
   - The maximum product could also be the product of the two smallest (most negative) numbers and the largest number.
3. Return the maximum of these two products.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort the array
        nums.sort()
        
        # The maximum product can be either the product of the three largest numbers
        # or the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number
        n = len(nums)
        max_product1 = nums[n-1] * nums[n-2] * nums[n-3]
        max_product2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[n-1]
        
        # Return the maximum of the two products
        return max(max_product1, max_product2)
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We first sort the array to easily access the largest and smallest numbers.
2. We calculate two potential maximum products:
   - `max_product1` is the product of the three largest numbers (`nums[n-1]`, `nums[n-2]`, `nums[n-3]`).
   - `max_product2` is the product of the two smallest numbers (`nums[0]` and `nums[1]`) and the largest number (`nums[n-1]`).
3. Finally, we return the maximum of these two products.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of three numbers to find the maximum product. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
ref:
def maximumProduct(nums):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)

        word_length = len(words[0])
        total_length = word_length * len(words)

                end += word_length
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `word_length` is the length of each word in the `words` array.
   - `total_length` is the total length of the concatenated substring, which is `word_length * len(words)`.
   - A `Counter` object `target_counter` is created to store the frequency of each word in the `words` array.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Starting Indices**:
   - We iterate over each possible starting index `start` in the string `s`.

3. **Collect Words in the Current Window**:
   - We use a `Counter` object `current_counter` to keep track of the words in the current window.
   - We collect words from the current window by slicing `s` from `end` to `end + word_length` and updating `current_counter`.

4. **Adjust the Window**:
   - If the size of the current window exceeds `total_length`, we remove the leftmost word from `current_counter` and adjust the window accordingly.

5. **Check

        # Initialize variables

        # Return the total number of ways to split the ranges
        return pow(2, total_groups, 10**9 + 7)
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Sort the Ranges**: The ranges are sorted by their starting points. This allows us to easily check for overlaps by comparing the ending points of consecutive ranges.

2. **Initialize Variables**: We initialize `total_groups` to 1, which represents the initial group. We also initialize `current_end` to the ending point of the first range.

3. **Iterate Through the Ranges**: We iterate through the sorted ranges starting from the second range.
   - If the current range overlaps with the previous range (i.e., its starting point is less than or equal to the `current_end`), we update `current_end` to the maximum of the two ends.
   - If the current range does not overlap with the previous range, we start a new group by incrementing `total_groups` and setting `current_end` to the ending point of the current range.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return `pow(2, total_groups, 10**9 + 7)`, which gives the total number of ways to split the ranges into two groups modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The result is \(2\) raised to the power of the number of groups, since each range can either be in group 1 or group 2. ```python
class Solution:
    def countWays(self, ranges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort ranges by their starting point
        ranges.sort(key=lambda x: x[

        return result
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Convert Words to Bitmask Representations**: 
   - We define a helper function `countBits` to convert each word to its bitmask representation, where each bit corresponds to whether a character is present in the word.
   - We define another helper function `findBits` to create a bitmask by flipping the bits of a given word.

2. **Build a Set of Bitmask Representations**:
   - We use a dictionary `bitmask_startWords` to store the bitmask representations of all words in `startWords`.

3. **Check Target Words**:
   - For each word in `targetWords`, we calculate its bitmask representation.
   - For each bit in the bitmask, we check if removing that bit results in a bitmask that exists in `bitmask_startWords`.
   - If such a bitmask exists, it means the word in `targetWords` can be formed from a word in `startWords` by appending a missing character and rearranging the letters.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - We count the number of target words that can be formed and return this count.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check if each target word can be formed from a word in `startWords` by leveraging bitmask operations and set membership checks. The time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of words in `startWords` and m is the length of the longest word, making it suitable for the given

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
```

To solve the problem of grouping anagrams together, we can use a dictionary to map sorted versions of the words to their corresponding groups. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Dictionary to store lists of anagrams
        anagram_dict = {}
        
        for word in strs:
            # Sort the word to get its canonical form
            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
            
            # If the sorted word is not in the dictionary, add it with the current word as the first element
            if sorted_word not in anagram_dict:
                anagram_dict[sorted_word] = [word]
            else:
                # Otherwise, append the current word to the existing list
                anagram_dict[sorted_word].append(word)
        
        # Return the values of the dictionary, which are lists of anagrams
        return list(anagram_dict.values())
```

### Explanation:

1. **Dictionary Initialization**: We initialize an empty dictionary `anagram_dict` to store lists of anagrams.

2. **Iterate Over Each Word**: For each word in the input list `strs`, we perform the following steps:

   - **Sort the Word**: We sort the characters of the word to create a canonical form. This canonical form will be used as the key in the dictionary.

   - **Check the Dictionary**: 
     - If the sorted word is not already a key in the dictionary, we add it with the current word as the first element of the list.
     - If the sorted word is already a key, we append the current word to the existing list of anagrams.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the values of the dictionary, which are lists of anagrams grouped by their sorted forms.

This approach ensures that all anagrams are grouped together efficiently, leveraging the properties of sorting and dictionaries. The time complexity is O(n * m log m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words, due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n * m) for storing the sorted words and their corresponding anagrams.

class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, height: int, width: int, tree: List[int], squirrel: List[int], nuts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of finding the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one, we can use a greedy approach. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, height: int, width: int, tree: List[int], squirrel: List[int], nuts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total_distance = 0
        
        # Calculate the total distance from the tree to each nut
        for nut in nuts:
            total_distance += 2 * abs(nut[0] - tree[0]) + 2 * abs(nut[1] - tree[1])
        
        # Calculate the extra distance the squirrel has to travel
        extra_distance = 0
        for nut in nuts:
            extra_distance += abs(squirrel[0] - nut[0]) + abs(squirrel[1] - nut[1]) - abs(nut[0] - tree[0]) - abs(nut[1] - tree[1])
        
        return total_distance + extra_distance
```

### Explanation:

1. **Total Distance Calculation:**
   - For each nut, calculate the total distance from the tree to the nut. This distance is twice the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates.
   - Sum these distances to get the total distance the squirrel would have to travel if it collected all nuts at the tree.

2. **Extra Distance Calculation:**
   - For each nut, calculate the extra distance the squirrel has to travel from the tree to the nut compared to if it collected the nut at the tree.
   - This extra distance is the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates from the squirrel to the nut minus the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates from the tree to the nut.
   - Sum these extra distances to get the total extra distance the squirrel has to travel.

3. **Final Result:**
   - Add the total distance to the total extra distance to get the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one.

This approach ensures that we find the optimal way to distribute the nuts around the tree to minimize the total 73%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž  | 22/30 [03:37<01:19,  9.89s/it]

        return False
```

This code defines a recursive function `checkPowersOfThree` that checks if a given number `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three. It iterates through all powers of three up to `n`, and for each power, it checks if subtracting that power from `n` results in another number that can also be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three. If such a number is found, it returns `True`. If no such number is found after checking all possibilities, it returns `False`. The base case for the recursion is when `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns `True` because an empty set of powers of three sums to zero. However, since the problem constraints guarantee that `n` is at least 1, this base case is not strictly necessary for the provided solution. Nonetheless, it is included to ensure completeness and correctness of the function. ```python
```python
class Solution:
    def checkPowersOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # Convert n to its base-3 representation
        base3 = []
        while n > 0:
            base3.append(n % 3)
            n //= 3
        
        # Check if any digit in the base-3 representation is greater than or equal to 2
        for digit in base3:
            if digit >= 2:
                return False
        
        return True
```

This code converts the given number `n` into its base-3 representation. It then checks each digit in this representation. If any digit is greater than or equal to 2, it means that `n` cannot be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three, so the function returns `False`. If all digits are less than 2, it means that `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three, so the function returns `True`. This approach avoids the need for recursion

class Solution:
    def maximumRequests(self, n: int, requests: List[List[int]]) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach. The idea is to explore all possible combinations of accepted requests and check if the net change in employees for each building is zero. If it is, we count that combination as a valid solution and keep track of the maximum number of accepted requests.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumRequests(self, n: int, requests: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def backtrack(index, current_requests, net_change):
            nonlocal max_accepted_requests
            
            # If we've considered all requests or found a valid solution
            if index == len(requests) or sum(net_change) == 0:
                if sum(net_change) == 0:
                    max_accepted_requests = max(max_accepted_requests, len(current_requests))
                return
            
            # Accept the current request
            net_change[requests[index][0]] -= 1
            net_change[requests[index][1]] += 1
            current_requests.append(requests[index])
            backtrack(index + 1, current_requests, net_change)
            
            # Reject the current request
            net_change[requests[index][0]] += 1
            net_change[requests[index][1]] -= 1
            current_requests.pop()
            backtrack(index + 1, current_requests, net_change)
        
        max_accepted_requests = 0
        backtrack(0, [], [0] * n)
        return max_accepted_requests
```

### Explanation:

1. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function is defined to explore all possible combinations of accepted requests. It takes three parameters:
   - `index`: The current index in the `requests` array.
   - `current_requests`: A list of requests that have been accepted so far.
   - `net_change`: An array representing the net change in employees for each building.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `index` equals the length of `requests`, it means we've considered all requests, and we check if the net change is zero. If it is, we update `max_accepted_requests`.
   - If the net change is zero, it means the current combination of accepted requests is valid.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Accept the current request by updating the `net_change` array and adding it to `
ref:
def maximumRequests(n, requests):
    req_size = len(requests)
    max_requests = 0

    for i in range(1 << req_size):
        net_transfers = [0] * n
        count = 0
        
        for j in range(req_size):
            if i & (1 << j):
                net_transfers[requests[j][0]] -= 1
                net_transfers[requests[j][1]] += 1
                count += 1

        valid = all(val == 0 for val in net_transfers)

        if valid:

class Solution:
    def getTargetCopy(self, original: TreeNode, cloned: TreeNode, target: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
```

To solve the LeetCode problem "Get Target Copy," we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse both the original and cloned trees simultaneously. When we find the target node in the original tree, we return the corresponding node in the cloned tree.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def getTargetCopy(self, original: TreeNode, cloned: TreeNode, target: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # Helper function to perform DFS
        def dfs(original, cloned):
            # Base case: if the current node is None, return None
            if original is None:
                return None
            # Check if the current node matches the target
            if original == target:
                return cloned
            # Recursively search in the left and right subtrees
            left = dfs(original.left, cloned.left)
            if left is not None:
                return left
            right = dfs(original.right, cloned.right)
            if right is not None:
                return right
            return None
        
        # Start the DFS from the root of the original tree
        return dfs(original, cloned)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Helper Function (`dfs`)**: This function performs a depth-first search on both the original and cloned trees. It takes two arguments: the current node in the original tree and the current node in the cloned tree.

2. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, it returns `None` because there are no more nodes to explore.

3. **Match Check**: If the current node in the original tree matches the target node, it returns the corresponding node in the cloned tree.

4. **Recursive Search**: The function recursively searches in the left and right subtrees. If a match is found in either subtree, it returns the corresponding node in the cloned tree.

5. **Return Result**: If no match is found in either subtree, the function returns `None`.

This approach ensures that we find the target node in the cloned tree while maintaining the constraints of the problem. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we need to visit each node once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, the height of the tree is O(n). However, since the problem

class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfApples(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Your code here
```

To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of apples that can be put in a basket with a weight limit of 5000 units, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the array of apple weights in ascending order.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total weight of the apples added to the basket.
3. Iterate through the sorted array, adding each apple's weight to the total weight.
4. If the total weight exceeds 5000 units, stop adding more apples.
5. Return the count of apples added to the basket.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfApples(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort the array of apple weights in ascending order
        arr.sort()
        
        # Initialize variables
        total_weight = 0
        max_apples = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted array
        for weight in arr:
            # Add the current apple's weight to the total weight
            total_weight += weight
            
            # Check if the total weight exceeds the limit
            if total_weight > 5000:
                break
            
            # Increment the count of apples added to the basket
            max_apples += 1
        
        return max_apples
```

This solution works as follows:

1. The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order to process the smallest weights first.
2. We initialize `total_weight` to keep track of the cumulative weight of the apples added to the basket and `max_apples` to count the number of apples.
3. We iterate through each weight in the sorted array:
   - We add the current weight to `total_weight`.
   - If `total_weight` exceeds 5000, we break out of the loop because we cannot add any more apples.
   - Otherwise, we increment `max_apples` by 1.
4. Finally, we return the count of apples added to the basket, which is stored in `max_apples`. 

This approach ensures that we maximize the number of apples while respecting the weight limit of the basket. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space. 77%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹  | 23/30 [03:47<01:09,  9.89s/it]

class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
```

To solve the problem of determining if a given string `s` follows the same pattern as a given `pattern`, we can use a dictionary to map each character in the pattern to a unique word in the string. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        # Split the string s into words
        words = s.split()
        
        # If the lengths of the pattern and words are not the same, return False
        if len(pattern) != len(words):
            return False
        
        # Create two dictionaries to store the mapping from pattern to word and vice versa
        pattern_to_word = {}
        word_to_pattern = {}
        
        # Iterate over the pattern and words simultaneously
        for p, w in zip(pattern, words):
            # Check if the current pattern character is already mapped to a word
            if p in pattern_to_word:
                # If it is, check if the mapped word matches the current word
                if pattern_to_word[p] != w:
                    return False
            else:
                # If it's not, add the mapping to the dictionary
                pattern_to_word[p] = w
            
            # Similarly, check for the reverse mapping
            if w in word_to_pattern:
                if word_to_pattern[w] != p:
                    return False
            else:
                word_to_pattern[w] = p
        
        # If all checks pass, return True
        return True
```

### Explanation:

1. **Splitting the String**: We first split the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method.

2. **Length Check**: We check if the length of the pattern is equal to the number of words. If they are not equal, it's impossible for the pattern to match the string, so we return `False`.

3. **Mapping Dictionaries**: We create two dictionaries:
   - `pattern_to_word`: Maps each character in the pattern to a unique word.
   - `word_to_pattern`: Maps each word in the string to a unique character in the pattern.

4. **Iterating and Checking**: We iterate over the pattern and words simultaneously using `zip()`. For each pair of characters and words:
   - We check if the current character in the pattern is already mapped to a word
ref:
def word_pattern(pattern, s):
    words = s.split()
    if len(pattern) != len(words):
        return False

    char_map, word_map = {}, {}
    for c, word in zip(pattern, words):
        if c not in char_map and word not in word_map:
            char_map[c] = word
            word_map[word] = c
        else:
            if char_map.get(c) != word or word_map.get(word) != c:
                return False

    return True

Sure! Below is the Python code for the given LeetCode problem:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        patches = 0
        current_sum = 0
        
        while current_sum < n:
            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= current_sum + 1:

        return patches
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is used to track the current index in the `nums` list.
   - `patches` is used to count the number of patches added.
   - `current_sum` is initialized to 0, representing the current range of numbers that can be formed.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If the current element in `nums` is less than or equal to `current_sum + 1`, it is added to `current_sum`, and `i` is incremented.
   - If the current element in `nums` is greater than `current_sum + 1`, a patch is added by adding `current_sum + 1` to `current_sum`, and `patches` is incremented.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns the total number of patches required.
ref:
def minPatches(nums, n):
    max_sum = 0
    patches = 0
    i = 0

    while max_sum < n:

```

This solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible ways to split the string. It starts from each character in the string and tries to split the string into substrings that satisfy the given conditions. The function `backtrack` is called recursively to explore further splits. If a valid split is found, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The initial call to `backtrack` starts from index 0 with a very large previous number to ensure that any valid split will have a smaller previous number. ```python

    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of finding the largest rectangle area in a histogram, we can use a stack-based approach. This method efficiently calculates the maximum area by maintaining a monotonic stack of indices. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        if not heights:
            return 0
        
        max_area = 0
        stack = []
        
        for i, height in enumerate(heights):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > height:
                top = stack.pop()
                width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, heights[top] * width)
            
            stack.append(i)
        
        while stack:
            top = stack.pop()
            width = len(heights) if not stack else len(heights) - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, heights[top] * width)
        
        return max_area
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `max_area` to store the maximum area found and a stack to keep track of indices of the histogram bars.

2. **Iterate through heights**: For each bar in the histogram, we check if the current bar is shorter than the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack.

3. **Calculate area**: If the current bar is shorter, we pop the index from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the popped bar and the current bar. The width of this rectangle is determined by the difference between the current index and the index of the previous bar in the stack, or the length of the histogram if the stack is empty.

4. **Update max_area**: We update `max_area` with the maximum area found so far.

5. **Push current index**: After processing the current bar, we push its index onto the stack.

6. **Final calculation**: After iterating through all bars, we process any remaining bars in the stack to ensure all rectangles are considered.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the largest rectangle area in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of bars in the histogram. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the stack used.

        for i in range(6):
            dp[0][i] = 1
        
        # Fill the dp array

        return sum(dp[-1]) % MOD
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid sequences of length `i` ending with each die face. It iterates through each possible previous sequence and updates the current sequence based on the constraints. The result is the sum of all valid sequences of length `n`. The `gcd` function is used to check if two adjacent numbers are coprime. The solution is efficient and handles the constraints provided. ```python

class Solution:
    def largestTriangleArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        # Implement your solution here
```

To solve the problem of finding the largest area of a triangle formed by any three different points from a given list of points on the X-Y plane, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

We will iterate through all possible combinations of three points and calculate the area for each combination. We will keep track of the maximum area found.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from itertools import combinations

class Solution:
    def largestTriangleArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        max_area = 0
        
        # Iterate over all combinations of three points
        for point1, point2, point3 in combinations(points, 3):
            x1, y1 = point1
            x2, y2 = point2
            x3, y3 = point3
            
            # Calculate the area using the formula
            area = abs(x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) / 2
            
            # Update the maximum area if the current area is larger
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area
        
        return max_area
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing Combinations**: We use `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible combinations of three points from the list.

2. **Iterating Over Combinations**: For each combination of three points, we extract their coordinates.

3. **Calculating Area**: We use the formula for the area of a triangle to calculate the area for the current combination of points.

4. **Updating Maximum Area**: If the calculated area is greater than the current maximum area, we update the maximum area.

5. **Returning Result**: Finally, we return the maximum area found.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible triangles and find the one with the largest area. 80%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ  | 24/30 [03:57<00:59,  9.89s/it]

```python
class Solution:
    def leftMostColumnWithOne(self, binaryMatrix: 'BinaryMatrix') -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of binary search and row traversal. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:

```python
class Solution:
    def leftMostColumnWithOne(self, binaryMatrix: 'BinaryMatrix') -> int:
        rows, cols = binaryMatrix.dimensions()
        result = cols
        
        # Iterate over each row
        for row in range(rows):
            # Use binary search to find the first occurrence of 1 in the current row
            left, right = 0, cols - 1
            while left <= right:
                mid = left + (right - left) // 2
                if binaryMatrix.get(row, mid) == 1:
                    result = min(result, mid)
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
                    
        return result if result != cols else -1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We start by getting the dimensions of the matrix and initialize `result` to `cols` (the maximum possible column index).

2. **Iterate Over Rows**: For each row in the matrix, we perform a binary search to find the first occurrence of `1`.

3. **Binary Search**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to perform a binary search on the current row:
   - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - If the element at `binaryMatrix.get(row, mid)` is `1`, update `result` to the minimum of `result` and `mid`, and move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching in the left half.
   - If the element is `0`, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.

4. **Return Result**: After processing all rows, if `result` is still `cols`, it means no `1` was found in any row, so we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return `result`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the leftmost column with a `1` using binary search within each row. The time complexity is O(rows * log(cols)), where `rows` is the number of rows and `cols` is the number of columns. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

Sure! Below is the Python code for the given LeetCode question:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPrefixOfWord(self, sentence: str, searchWord: str) -> int:
        # Split the sentence into words
        words = sentence.split()
        
        # Iterate over the words
        for index, word in enumerate(words):
            # Check if the searchWord is a prefix of the current word
            if word.startswith(searchWord):
                # Return the 1-indexed position of the word
                return index + 1
        
        # If no match is found, return -1
        return -1
```

### Explanation:
1. **Splitting the Sentence**: The sentence is split into a list of words using the `split()` method. This method splits the string at each space character.
2. **Iterating Over Words**: We iterate over the list of words using `enumerate()`, which provides both the index and the word.
3. **Checking Prefix**: For each word, we use the `startswith()` method to check if the `searchWord` is a prefix of the word.
4. **Returning the Index**: If a match is found, we return the 1-indexed position of the word by adding 1 to the zero-based index.
5. **No Match Found**: If no word matches the `searchWord`, we return -1. 

This solution efficiently checks each word in the sentence and returns the correct index or -1 based on the conditions provided.

1. **Base Case**: If the list is empty or has only one node, it is already sorted, so we return it as is.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - `find_tail(node)`: This function finds the last node in the linked list.
   - `merge(left, right)`: This function merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.

3. **Splitting the List**:
   - We use the slow and fast pointer technique to split the list into two halves. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.
   - We then split the list into two parts: `left` (from the start to

        return head

    prev = head
    cur = head.next

    while cur:
        if cur.val < prev.val:
            prev.next = cur.next
            cur.next = head
            head = cur
            cur = prev
        else:
            prev = cur
        cur = cur.next

    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
```

And here is the test case:
```python
def test_rotate():
    assert Solution().rotate([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]) == [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

```

To solve the problem of rotating an `n x n` matrix in-place by 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Transpose the Matrix**: Swap the elements at position `(i, j)` with the element at position `(j, i)`.
2. **Reverse Each Row**: After transposing, reverse each row of the matrix.

Here's the Python implementation of the `rotate` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(matrix)
        
        # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
        
        # Step 2: Reverse each row
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i].reverse()
```

### Explanation:

- **Transposing the Matrix**: We use a nested loop to iterate over each element of the matrix. For each element at position `(i, j)`, we swap it with the element at position `(j, i)`. This effectively transposes the matrix.

- **Reversing Each Row**: After transposing, we reverse each row of the matrix. This step completes the 90-degree clockwise rotation.

This approach modifies the matrix in-place without using any additional space, meeting the problem's constraints. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix,
ref:
def rotate(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        for j in range(i, n - i - 1):
            temp = matrix[i][j]
            matrix[i][j] = matrix[n - j - 1][i]
            matrix[n - j - 1][i] = matrix[n - i - 1][n - j - 1]
            matrix[n - i - 1][n - j - 1] = matrix[j][n - i - 1]
            matrix[j][n - i - 1] = temp

```

To solve the problem of reordering a singly linked list such that it follows the pattern \( L0 \rightarrow Ln \rightarrow L1 \rightarrow Ln-1 \rightarrow L2 \rightarrow Ln-2 \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the Middle of the List**: Use the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list. This will help us split the list into two halves.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**: Reverse the second half of the list starting from the middle node.

3. **Merge the Two Halves**: Merge the two halves by alternating nodes from each half.

Here's the Python implementation of the above approach:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

        if not head or not head.next:
            return
        
        # Step 1: Find the middle of the list
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the second half

            prev = curr
            curr = next_node
        
        # Step 3: Merge the two halves
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first, second = temp1, temp2
```

### Explanation:

1. **Finding the Middle**: We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. When the `fast` pointer reaches the end, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle of the list.

2. **Reversing the Second Half**: We reverse the second half of the list starting from the middle node. We maintain a `prev` pointer to keep track of the previous node and a `curr` pointer to traverse the list. We swap the `next

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `longestPalindromeSubseq` that calculates the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string `s`. The method uses dynamic programming to fill a table where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`. The solution iterates over all possible lengths of substrings, comparing characters and updating the table accordingly. Finally, it returns the value at `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is also O(n^2). The constraints of the problem are handled efficiently within this approach.

And here is the solution function:

```

Please fill in the implementation of the `makeStringSorted` function. ```python
from typing import List

        n = len(s)
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        smaller_right = [0] * n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == 'z':
                smaller_right[i] = n - i - 1
            else:
                smaller_right[i] = smaller_right[i + 1] + (ord(s[i]) - ord('a') < ord(s[i + 1]) - ord('a'))
        
        # Compute the number of operations needed to sort the string
        operations = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] != 'a':
                # Find the smallest index j such that s[j] > s[i]
                j = i
                while j < n and s[j] <= s[i]:
                    j += 1
                # Perform the swap and reverse operation
                operations += (j - i - 1) * (smaller_right[j] - smaller_right[i])
                operations %= MOD
        
        return operations
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We first compute the number of smaller elements to the right of each element using a prefix sum approach. This allows us to quickly determine how many elements need to be swapped to the right of each element to make it the smallest possible element.

2. We then iterate through the string and for each element that is not already the smallest possible element, we find the smallest index `j` such that `s[j] > s[i]`. We perform the swap and reverse operation, which involves counting the number of operations needed to sort the suffix starting at `i`.

3. We accumulate the total number of operations needed to sort the entire string and return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\). ```python

This solution class contains a method `mincostToHireWorkers` that takes in three parameters: `quality`, `wage`, and `k`. The method should return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the given conditions.

        return min_cost
```

This implementation works as follows:

1. We first sort the workers based on the ratio of their wage to their quality. This ensures that the worker with the highest ratio is processed first.

2. We initialize a variable `total_quality` to

This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to calculate the shortest distance from each building to all empty lands. It keeps track of the total distance traveled to each empty land and returns the minimum distance among all empty lands. If no valid house can be built, it returns -1. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We first find all buildings and count the number of empty lands in the grid. We mark the empty lands with `float('inf')` initially.
   - We define the possible directions for movement (up, down, left, right).

2. **Building Shortest

class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
```

To solve the N-Queens problem, we can use backtracking. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        def is_valid(row, col, queens):
            # Check if there is a queen in the same column
            for queen in queens:
                if queen[1] == col:
                    return False
            
            # Check if there is a queen in the same diagonal
            for queen in queens:
                if abs(queen[0] - row) == abs(queen[1] - col):
                    return False
            
            return True
        
        def backtrack(row, queens):
            if row == n:
                # If all rows are filled, add the current configuration to the result
                result.append([''.join('Q' if i == col else '.' for i in range(n)) for col in queens])
                return
            
            for col in range(n):
                if is_valid(row, col, queens):
                    # Place the queen and move to the next row
                    queens.append((row, col))
                    backtrack(row + 1, queens)
                    # Backtrack by removing the queen
                    queens.pop()
        
        result = []
        backtrack(0, [])
        return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **is_valid Function**: This function checks if it's safe to place a queen at a given position `(row, col)` in the current configuration of queens. It ensures that no other queen is in the same column or diagonal.

2. **backtrack Function**: This recursive function tries to place queens row by row. For each row, it iterates through each column and checks if placing a queen at that position is valid. If it is, the queen is placed, and the function moves to the next row. If not, the function backtracks by removing the last placed queen and trying the next column.

3. **Result Collection**: When all rows are filled, the current configuration of queens is added to the result list. Each configuration is represented as a list of strings, where each string is a row of the chessboard.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the list of all distinct solutions to the N-Queens problem.

        i, j = row, col
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            if board[i][j] == 'Q': return False
            i, j = i - 1, j - 1
        i, j = row, col
        while i < n and j >= 0:
            if board[i][j] == 'Q': return False
            i, j = i + 1, j - 1
        return True

    def solve(result, board, n, col):
        if col == n:
            result.append(board.copy())
            return

                solve(result, board, n, col + 1)
                board[row] = board[row][:col] + '.' + board[row][col + 1:]

class Solution:
    def countRectangles(self, rectangles: List[List[int]], points: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
```

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of sorting and binary search. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the given requirements:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countRectangles(self, rectangles: List[List[int]], points: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Sort rectangles by height in descending order
        rectangles.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
        
        # Create a list to store the heights of rectangles at each index
        height_list = [0] * 101
        
        # Populate the height list with the heights of rectangles
        for rect in rectangles:
            height_list[rect[1]] += 1
        
        # Initialize the result list
        result = []
        
        # For each point, find the number of rectangles that contain it
        for point in points:
            x, y = point
            # Use binary search to find the number of rectangles with height >= y
            index = self.binary_search(height_list, y)
            result.append(len(height_list) - index)
        
        return result
    
    def binary_search(self, arr: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(arr)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if arr[mid] >= target:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting Rectangles**: We first sort the rectangles by their height in descending order. This allows us to efficiently count the number of rectangles that contain a given point by leveraging the sorted order.

2. **Height List Construction**: We create a list `height_list` where `height_list[i]` represents the number of rectangles with height `i`. This helps in quickly counting the number of rectangles that have a height greater than or equal to a given threshold.

3. **Binary Search for Point Containment**: For each point `(x, y)`, we use binary search to find the index in `height_list` where the height starts being greater than or equal to `y`. The difference between the length of `height_list` and this index gives us the number of rectangles that contain the point.

4. **Result Compilation**: We compile the results for all points and

class Solution:
    def knightProbability(self, N: int, K: int, r: int, c: int) -> float:
```

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. The idea is to keep track of the probability of being at each cell after a certain number of moves. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def knightProbability(self, N: int, K: int, r: int, c: int) -> float:
        # Directions for a knight's move
        directions = [
            (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),
            (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)
        ]
        
        # Memoization dictionary to store probabilities
        memo = {}
        
        def dfs(x, y, moves):
            # Base case: if out of bounds or no more moves left
            if x < 0 or x >= N or y < 0 or y >= N or moves == 0:
                return 1
            
            # Check if result is already computed
            if (x, y, moves) in memo:
                return memo[(x, y, moves)]
            
            prob = 0
            # Explore all possible moves
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                prob += dfs(nx, ny, moves - 1) / 8
            
            # Store the result in memoization
            memo[(x, y, moves)] = prob
            return prob
        
        # Start the DFS from the initial position
        return dfs(r, c, K)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Directions**: We define the possible moves of a knight using a list of tuples.

2. **Memoization**: We use a dictionary `memo` to store the probability of being at each cell `(x, y)` after `moves` moves. This helps in avoiding redundant calculations.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is a recursive function that calculates the probability of being at cell `(x, y)` after `moves` moves. It returns `1` if the cell is out of bounds or if no more moves are left.

4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each cell, we explore all possible moves and sum up the probabilities of reaching those cells. We divide by 87%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹ | 26/30 [04:17<00:39,  9.91s/it]

        # Return the largest lucky integer found

```

This code defines a method `findLucky` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the largest lucky integer in the array. A lucky integer is defined as an integer that appears in the array with a frequency equal to its value. The method uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each number in the array and then iterates through the dictionary to find the largest lucky integer. If no lucky integer is found, it returns -1. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is also O(n) due to the dictionary used to store the frequency counts. ```python
```python

            dfs(node.right, level + 1)
        
        dfs(root, 0)
        return root
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We define a helper function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree.
2. The `dfs` function takes two parameters: the current node and the current level.
3. If the current node is `None`, we return.
4. If the current level is odd, we swap the values of the current node and its right child.
5. We recursively call `dfs` on the left and right children of the current node, incrementing the level by 1.
6. Finally, we call the `dfs` function starting from the root with level 0 and return the modified root.

This approach ensures that we correctly reverse the node values at each odd level of the tree while maintaining the structure of the perfect binary tree. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. ``` ``` ```python

        # Return the value at that snapshot ID
        return self.snapshots[index][i-1][1] if i > 0 else 0
```

This implementation uses a dictionary to store snapshots for each index. Each snapshot is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a snapshot ID and the corresponding value. The `set` method adds a new snapshot for the given index, and the `snap` method increments the current snapshot ID. The `get` method finds the first snapshot ID that is less than or equal to the given snapshot ID and returns the corresponding value. If no such snapshot exists, it returns 0. The use of binary search in the `get` method allows for efficient retrieval of the value at the given snapshot ID. ```python
class SnapshotArray:

    def __init__(self, length: int):
        self.snapshots = {}
        self.current_snap_id = 0

To solve the problem of finding the sum of the `n` smallest k-mirror numbers, we can use a recursive approach to generate k-mirror numbers. Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python

    def kMirror(self, k: int, n: int) -> int:
        def is_k_mirror(num: str) -> bool:

### Explanation:

1. **is_k_mirror Function**: This helper function checks if a given string is a k-mirror number. It ensures that the string reads the same forwards and backwards and that each digit matches its corresponding digit in the reverse string modulo `k`.

2. **generate_k_mirror Function**: This recursive function generates k-mirror numbers of a given length and parity. It uses two branches:
   - Even-length numbers: These are formed by concatenating digits and their reverse, ensuring that the middle digit (if any) is a single digit.

class Solution:
    def sumFourDivisors(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Your code here
```

To solve the problem of finding the sum of divisors of integers with exactly four divisors from a given list of integers, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each number in the list.
2. For each number, determine its divisors.
3. Check if the number has exactly four divisors.
4. If it does, add the sum of its divisors to the result.
5. Return the total sum.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def sumFourDivisors(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def get_divisors(n):
            divisors = []
            for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
                if n % i == 0:
                    divisors.append(i)
                    if i != n // i:
                        divisors.append(n // i)
            return divisors
        
        result = 0
        for num in nums:
            divisors = get_divisors(num)
            if len(divisors) == 4:
                result += sum(divisors)
        
        return result
```

### Explanation:

- **`get_divisors(n)` Function**: This helper function calculates all divisors of a given number `n`. It iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` and checks for divisors. If `i` is a divisor, both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list of divisors.
  
- **Main Logic**: We iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. For each number, we call `get_divisors` to get its divisors. If the length of the list of divisors is exactly four, we add the sum of these divisors to the result.

- **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total sum of the divisors of numbers with exactly four divisors. If no such numbers exist, the result remains zero. 

This solution efficiently finds the required sum by leveraging the properties of divisors and iterating through each number only once. The time complexity is O(n * sqrt(m)), where `n` is the number of elements in the list and `m` is the maximum value in the list. This approach ensures that we handle the constraints effectively.

            result[i] = char
        
        # Join the list into a string and return it
        return ''.join(result)
```

This code defines a method `restoreString` that takes a string `s` and a list of indices `indices` as input. It creates a list `result` of the same length as `s` to store the characters in their new positions. It then iterates through the indices and characters using the `zip` function, placing each character at the corresponding index in the `result` list. Finally, it joins the list into a string and returns it. This approach ensures that the characters in the original string are rearranged according to the specified indices. The constraints guarantee that this operation is feasible within the given limits. 

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a list `result` of the same length as `s` with empty strings. This list will store the characters in their new positions.

2. **Iteration**: We use the `zip` function to iterate over both the `indices` and `s` lists simultaneously. For each pair `(i, char)`, we place the character `char` at the index `i` in the `result` list.

3. **Joining**: After filling the `result` list, we join the list into a single string using `''.join(result)` and return it.

This method efficiently rearranges the characters in the string `s` based on the provided indices, ensuring that the output string matches the expected shuffled order. The constraints guarantee that this operation is feasible within the given limits. 

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a list `result` of the same length as `s` with empty strings. This list will store the characters in their new positions.

2. **Iteration**: We use the `zip` function to iterate over both the `indices` and `s` lists simultaneously. For each pair `(i, char)`, we place the character `char` at the index `i` in the `result` list.

        return result
```

This solution works by first finding the root of each node using the `findRoot` function. Then, it uses the `findCycleLength` function to find the length of the cycle between the two nodes. The `findRoot` function recursively finds the root of a node by dividing the node's value by 2 until it reaches 1. The `findCycleLength` function then finds the length of the cycle by comparing the roots of the two nodes and moving up the tree until they meet. The length of the cycle is the number of edges between the two nodes. Finally, the solution appends the length of the cycle to the result list for each query. ```python

This solution works by defining a helper function `count_digits` to count the occurrences of the digit `d` in a given number.

            return random_number
        # Otherwise, return the corresponding blacklisted number
        return self.valid_to_blacklisted[random_number]
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Convert the `blacklist` array to a set for O(1) lookups.
   - Create a dictionary `valid_to_blacklisted` to map valid numbers to their corresponding blacklisted numbers.
   - Determine the size of the valid range, which is `n - len(blacklist)`.
   - Iterate over the valid range and map blacklisted numbers to valid numbers. If a valid number is already mapped, skip it. Otherwise, find the next valid number that is not in the blacklist and map it to the current blacklisted number.

2. **Pick Method**:
   - Generate a random number within the valid range using `random.randint`.
   - If the random number is in the valid range, return it directly.
   - Otherwise, return the corresponding blacklisted number from the `valid_to_blacklisted` dictionary.

This approach ensures that the `pick` method has a time complexity of O(1) on average, making it efficient for large input sizes. The use of a dictionary allows for quick lookups and mappings between valid and blacklisted numbers. Additionally, the solution minimizes the number of calls to the built-in random function by leveraging the properties of sets and dictionaries.

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify connected components in the graph. Each connected component represents a group of nodes that are reachable from each other. Once we have identified all connected components, we can calculate the number of unreachable pairs of nodes.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Create an adjacency list representation of the graph
        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            adj_list[u].append(v)
            adj_list[v].append(u)
        
        # Initialize variables to keep track of the number of nodes in each component
        component_sizes = []
        visited = set()
        
        # Perform DFS to find connected components
        def dfs(node):
            if node in visited:
                return 0
            visited.add(node)
            size = 1
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                size += dfs(neighbor)
            return size
        
        # Find the size of each connected component
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                component_sizes.append(dfs(i))
        
        # Calculate the number of unreachable pairs
        total_pairs = 0
        for size in component_sizes:
            total_pairs += size * (n - size)
        return total_pairs // 2
```

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Representation**: We use an adjacency list to represent the graph. This allows us to efficiently traverse the graph using DFS.

2. **DFS Traversal**: We perform a DFS starting from each unvisited node to explore the connected component. Each DFS call returns the size of the component.

3. **Component Sizes**: We store the size of each connected component in the `component_sizes` list.

4. **Unreachable Pairs Calculation**: For each component of size `size`, the number of unreachable pairs with nodes in other components is `size * (n - size)`. We sum these values to get the total number of unreachable pairs.

5. **Result**: Finally, we return the total number of unreachable pairs divided by 2, as each pair is counted twice.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of unreachable pairs by leveraging the properties of connected components in the graph. The time complexity is O

                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        
        return max_length
```

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `maxTurbulenceSize` that takes an integer array `arr` as input and returns the length of the longest turbulent subarray. The method uses a simple iterative approach to check each pair of adjacent elements in the array to determine if they form a turbulent subarray. It keeps track of the current length of the turbulent subarray and updates the maximum length found so far. The method handles edge cases where the array has only one element. Here are the example test cases provided:

- Example 1: Input: `[9,4,2,10,7,8,8,1,9]`, Output: `5`
- Example 2: Input: `[4,8,12,16]`, Output: `2`

```python
class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
```

To solve the given problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We'll traverse the tree and build the path from the root to each leaf node. When we reach a leaf node, we'll add the current path to the result list. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import Optional, List

class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
        def dfs(node, path):
            if not node:
                return
            # Add the current node's value to the path
            path += str(node.val)
            # If it's a leaf node, add the path to the result list
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                paths.append(path)
            else:
                # Recursively traverse left and right subtrees
                dfs(node.left, path + '->')
                dfs(node.right, path + '->')
        
        paths = []
        dfs(root, '')
        return paths
```

### Explanation:

1. **DFS Function**: We define a helper function `dfs` that takes a node and the current path as arguments.
   - If the node is `None`, we return immediately.
   - We append the current node's value to the path string.
   - If the node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right children), we add the current path to the `paths` list.
   - Otherwise, we recursively call `dfs` for the left and right children, appending `'->'` between nodes to separate them in the path string.

2. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `paths` to store the final result and call the `dfs` function starting from the root with an empty path string.

3. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `paths` list containing all the root-to-leaf paths.

        def find(x):

            return parent[x]
        
        # Function to perform union of two sets
        def union(x, y):
            root_x = find(x)
            root_y = find(y)
            if root_x != root_y:
                parent[root_x] = root_y
        
        # Initialize variables for MST
        mst_cost = 0
        num_edges = 0
        
        # Process the priority queue to build the MST
        while pq and num_edges < n - 1:
            dist, u, v = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if find(u) != find(v):

        return mst_cost
```

### Explanation:

1. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**: We define a helper function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: We initialize a priority queue (min-heap) with edges from the first point to all other points. Each edge is represented by a tuple `(distance, u, v)` where `u` and `v` are the indices of the points.

```

This Python solution uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of a substring in `s` that can be changed to match the corresponding substring in `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. The solution iterates through the string with two pointers, `left` and `right`, and calculates the total cost of changing the characters within the current window. If the total cost exceeds `maxCost`, it adjusts the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right until the cost is within the limit. The maximum length of such a substring is tracked and returned at the end. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the strings, making it efficient for the given constraints. ```python
class Solution:
    def equalSubstring(self, s: str, t: str, maxCost: int) -> int:

This implementation initializes an empty list `requests` to store the timestamps of the incoming requests. The `ping` method adds the new request timestamp `t` to the list and then removes any timestamps that are outside the 3000 ms range from the beginning of the list using a while loop. Finally, it returns the number of requests within the 3000 ms range by returning the length of the `requests` list. This approach ensures that the list only contains timestamps within the 3000 ms range and efficiently handles the `ping` method calls. ```python

                            dp[i][mask | (1 << (j - 1))] = max(dp[i][mask | (1 << (j - 1))], dp[i][mask] + 1)
        
        return max(dp[m])
```

This code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It iterates through each row of the seats and checks if the current mask of occupied seats is valid. If it is, it updates the maximum number of students that can be seated in that row and column combination. The final result is the maximum number of students that can be seated without any cheating being possible. The constraints are handled by checking if the current mask is valid and if the student is sitting in a good condition. The code uses bit manipulation to efficiently check and update the masks. ```python

    def maxStudents(self, seats: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(seats), len(seats[0])

    def minimumTime(self, hens: List[int], grains: List[int]) -> int:
```

Sure! Below is the Python code for the `minimumTime` function based on the problem description:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, hens: List[int], grains: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort both lists to facilitate pairing
        hens.sort()
        grains.sort()
        
        # Initialize the maximum time to eat all grains
        max_time = 0
        
        # Use two pointers to pair hens with grains
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < len(hens) and j < len(grains):
            # Calculate the time it takes for the current hen to reach the current grain
            time_to_reach = abs(hens[i] - grains[j])
            
            # Update the maximum time
            max_time = max(max_time, time_to_reach)
            
            # Move the pointer for the grain that has been reached
            j += 1
        
        return max_time
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: We first sort both the `hens` and `grains` lists. This allows us to efficiently pair hens with grains that are closest to them.

2. **Two Pointers**: We use two pointers, `i` for the `hens` list and `j` for the `grains` list. We iterate through these lists simultaneously.

3. **Calculating Time**: For each pair of hen and grain, we calculate the absolute difference in their positions, which represents the time it would take for the hen to reach the grain.

4. **Updating Maximum Time**: We keep track of the maximum time encountered during the iteration.

5. **Moving Pointers**: Once a hen reaches a grain, we move the pointer for the grain to the next one.

6. **Result**: Finally, we return the maximum time, which is the minimum time required to eat all grains optimally.

class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of finding the minimum positive starting value such that the step-by-step sum of the array is never less than 1, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the prefix sums of the array.
2. Determine the minimum prefix sum.
3. The minimum positive starting value should be such that adding this value to the minimum prefix sum results in at least 1.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Calculate prefix sums
        prefix_sums = [0]
        for num in nums:
            prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)
        
        # Find the minimum prefix sum
        min_prefix_sum = min(prefix_sums)
        
        # The minimum positive starting value
        # is the smallest number that can be added to the minimum prefix sum to make it at least 1
        return 1 - min_prefix_sum if min_prefix_sum < 0 else 1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: We calculate the prefix sums of the array. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Prefix Sum**: We determine the minimum value in the list of prefix sums. This will help us understand the lowest point in the cumulative sum.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Starting Value**: 
   - If the minimum prefix sum is negative, we need to add a value greater than or equal to the absolute value of the minimum prefix sum to ensure the sum is never less than 1.
   - If the minimum prefix sum is non-negative, we only need to add 1 to ensure the sum is always at least 1.

This approach ensures that we find the minimum positive starting value efficiently. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of prefix sums. 

Let's test the solution with the provided examples:

# Test cases
print(Solution().minStartValue([-3, 2, -3, 4, 2]))  # Output: 5
print(Solution().minStartValue([1, 2]))

    def minPushBox(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:

To solve the problem of moving the box to the target in the storekeeper game, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a priority queue to ensure that we explore the most promising states first. Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

    def pick(self, target):
        indices = self.num_to_indices[target]

This solution works as follows:

1. In the constructor `__init__`, we initialize a dictionary `num_to_indices` where the keys are the unique numbers in `nums` and the values are lists of indices where these numbers appear in `nums`.

2. For each number in `nums`, we append its index to the list corresponding to its key in `num_to_indices`.

3. The `pick` method takes a target number and returns a random index from the list of indices corresponding to the target number. This ensures that each index has an equal probability of being returned.

This approach ensures that the `pick` method runs in O(1) time on average because it directly accesses the list of indices for the target number. The overall time complexity for initializing the object is O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. The time complexity for the `pick` method is O(1). The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of indices in the dictionary. ```python

    def longestPalindrome(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
```

To solve this problem, we need to find the longest palindromic subsequence that can be formed by concatenating subsequences from `word1` and `word2`. Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:

1. **Concatenate the Two Words**: Combine `word1` and `word2` into a single string `s` for easier processing. This allows us to use dynamic programming to find the longest palindromic subsequence.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

3. **Base Case**: Initialize `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`, since a single character is a palindrome of length 1.

4. **Fill the DP Table**: For each substring `s[i:j+1]`, check if `s[i]` is equal to `s[j]`. If they are equal, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

5. **Result Calculation**: The result will be stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the concatenated string `s`.

Here's the complete Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        # Concatenate the two words

        # Your implementation goes here
```

To solve the problem of maximizing the score of a binary matrix after making any number of moves, we can follow these steps:

1. **Toggle Rows**: For each row, if the first element is 0, toggle the entire row to make the first element 1. This ensures that the most significant bit (MSB) is always 1 for each row.

2. **Toggle Columns**: For each column, count the number of 0s. If the number of 0s is greater than or equal to half the number of rows, toggle the entire column. This ensures that the majority of rows have a 1 in this column, maximizing the score.

3. **Calculate Score**: After making the necessary toggles, convert each row to its decimal equivalent and sum them up to get the final score.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python

The base case for the recursion is when the rectangle contains no ships or when it is a single point, in which case it returns 1 or 0 respectively. The solution also includes checks to ensure that the input points are valid and that the recursive calls do not exceed the maximum allowed number of calls to the `hasShips` API. Here's the complete code:

```python
class Solution:
    def countShips(self, sea: 'Sea', topRight: 'Point', bottomLeft: 'Point') -> int:
        if not sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft):
            return 0
        
        if topRight.x == bottomLeft.x and topRight.y == bottomLeft.y:
            return 1
        
        mid_x = (topRight.x + bottomLeft.x) // 2
        mid_y = (topRight.y + bottomLeft.y) // 2
        
        ships_in_upper_left = self.countShips(sea, Point(mid_x, mid_y), bottomLeft)
        ships_in_lower_left = self.countShips(sea, Point(mid_x

        # Return an empty string if no valid time is found
        return ""
```

This solution works by iterating through all possible permutations of the array and checking if the time is valid. It then returns the latest valid time in the required format. If no valid time is found, it returns an empty string. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. We iterate through all possible permutations of the array using four nested loops.
2. For each permutation, we extract the hours and minutes from the array.
3. We check if the time is valid by ensuring that the hours are between 0 and 23 and the minutes are between 0 and 59.
4. If the time is valid, we return the time in the required format using the `f-string` formatting.
5. If no valid time is found after checking all permutations, we return an empty string. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(4!) which is approximately 24, and a space complexity of O(1) since we are only using a few variables to store the hours and minutes. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

    def largestTimeFromDigits(self, arr: List[int]) -> str:

class Solution:
    def insertIntoBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
```

To solve the problem of inserting a value into a Binary Search Tree (BST), we need to follow these steps:

1. If the tree is empty (`root` is `None`), create a new node with the given value and return it.
2. Traverse the tree:
   - If the current node's value is greater than the target value, move to the left child.
   - If the current node's value is less than the target value, move to the right child.
3. Once you find the appropriate position (either at a leaf or where the value should be inserted), create a new node with the given value and attach it to the correct position.

Here's the implementation of the `insertIntoBST` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def insertIntoBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return TreeNode(val)
        
        current = root
        
        while True:
            if current.val > val:
                if current.left:
                    current = current.left
                else:
                    current.left = TreeNode(val)
                    break
            else:
                if current.right:
                    current = current.right
                else:
                    current.right = TreeNode(val)
                    break
        
        return root
```

This code works as follows:

- We first check if the tree is empty. If it is, we create a new node with the given value and return it.
- We then traverse the tree using a while loop:
  - If the current node's value is greater than the target value, we move to the left child. If the left child is not null, we continue; otherwise, we create a new node with the target value and attach it as the left child.
  - If the current node's value is less than the target value, we move to the right child. If the right child is not null, we continue; otherwise, we create a new node with the target value and attach it as the right child.
- Once we find the appropriate position, we break out of the loop and return the modified tree.

This approach ensures that the tree remains a valid BST after the insertion. The time complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, and the space complexity is O(1) if we do not consider the recursion stack space. However, due to the
ref:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def insertIntoBST(root, val):
    if root is None:
        return TreeNode(val)

    if val < root.val:
        root.left = insertIntoBST(root.left, val)
    else:
        root.right = insertIntoBST(root.right, val)

    return root

    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:

This code directly returns `False` because there are no strictly palindromic numbers within the given constraints. The problem statement is a trick question, as no number in the range from 4 to 10^5 can satisfy the condition of being strictly palindromic in all bases from 2 to n-2. Therefore, the function always returns `False`.

And here is the `read4` method:
```python
def read4(buf4):
    # Implement the read4 method here
    pass
```

Here is the complete solution class with the `read` method implemented:
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize any necessary variables here
        self.buffer = []
    
    def read(self, buf, n):
        # Read n characters from file and store them in buf
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if not self.buffer:
                # If buffer is empty, read from file using read4
                buf4 = [''] * 4
                num_read = read4(buf4)

                self.buffer = buf4[:num_read]
            
            # Read from buffer and store in buf
            buf[i] = self.buffer.pop(0)
            i += 1
        
        return i
```

This solution maintains a buffer to store characters read from the file using `read4`. It reads from the buffer first and then from the file when the buffer is empty. The `read` method returns the number of characters actually read, which can be less than `n` if the file ends before `n` characters are read. The `read4` method is assumed to be implemented elsewhere and takes a buffer `buf4` of size 4 and returns the number of characters actually read. The `__init__` method initializes the `buffer` list to store characters read from the file. ```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize any necessary variables here
        self.buffer = []
        self.buffer_size = 0
