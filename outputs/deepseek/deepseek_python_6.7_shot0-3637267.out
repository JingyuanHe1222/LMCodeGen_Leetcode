You can add any helper functions or classes you need inside this class.

Write your code here:

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution(object):
    def beautySum(self, s):
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            cnt = Counter()
            max_freq = 0
            for j in range(i, len(s)):
                cnt[s[j]] += 1
                max_freq = max(max_freq, max(cnt.values()))
                if len(cnt) > 1:
                    res += max_freq - min(cnt.values())
        return res
```
The time complexity of this code is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. This is because we use two nested loops, each going through the string once. The space complexity is O(1), as the maximum number of unique characters that appear in the string is constant (26 for all lowercase English letters).

This code works by iterating over each character in the string, and then for each character, it creates all possible substrings starting from that character. It keeps track of the frequency of each character in the substring using a Counter object. Then it calculates the beauty of the substring by subtracting the minimum frequency from the maximum frequency. If there are more than one types of characters in the substring, it adds the beauty to the total result.

        """
        :type nums: List[int]

Here is the python code for the solution:

```python
from collections import Counter
import operator

class Solution(object):
    def frequencySort(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]

        """
        count = Counter(nums)
        nums.sort(key=lambda x: (count[x], -x))
        return nums
```

In this solution, we first use the `Counter` from the `collections` module to get the frequency of each number in the list. Then we sort the list by the frequency of the numbers first (using `count[x]` as the key), and then by the value of the number in reverse order (-x). This means that if two numbers have the same frequency, the one with the higher value will come first.

```

You can use this class like so:

```python
s = Solution()
print(s.maxCount(3, 3, [[2,2],[3,3]]))  # Output: 4
```

This code works by first initializing a `m x n` matrix filled with zeros. It then iterates over each operation, incrementing the values in the matrix corresponding to the operation's dimensions. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the matrix.

```
This is the code for the above problem. This code uses depth first search to solve the problem. It creates a graph using adjacency list representation and then checks for bicolorability of the graph by assigning colors to nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If it's possible to do so, it returns True otherwise False.

This code works by first creating a graph using adjacency list representation. Then for each node, it tries to assign it a color such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If it's possible to do so for all nodes, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The time complexity of this code is O(N + E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges. This is because in the worst case, we might have to visit all nodes and all edges. The space complexity is also O(N + E), which is used to store the graph and the colors assigned to nodes.

Please note that you need to run this code in an environment where Python is installed and you have access to the required libraries (collections).

I am trying to understand this code but I don't understand how it works. Could you please explain it to me in detail?


A: The function isAdditiveNumber checks whether the given string num represents an additive number or not. It does this by recursively checking all possible combinations of starting indices for the first two numbers and the third number in the sequence.

In the nested loop within isAdditiveNumber, the outer loop iterates over all possible starting indices for the first number, and the inner loop iterates over all possible starting indices for the second number. For each pair of indices, the function calls isValid to check whether the numbers formed by these indices are valid in the sequence.

The isValid function takes three arguments: the start index i, and the end indices j and k. It slices the string num into three parts: the first number x from index i to j, the second number y from index j to k, and the rest of the string z from index k to the end. If any of these numbers has more than one digit and starts with a '0', or if the sum of the first two numbers doesn't match the third number, the function returns False. Otherwise, it checks whether the rest of the string forms a valid sequence by calling itself recursively with the new start index k and the end of the string.

If no invalid combination is found and the entire string forms a valid sequence, the function returns True. If no

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def increasingBST(self, root):
        def inorder(node):
            if node:
                inorder(node.left)
                node.left = None
                self.cur.right = node
                self.cur = node
                inorder(node.right)

        ans = self.cur = TreeNode(None)
        inorder(root)
        return ans.right
```

In this solution, we are using a recursive approach to perform an in-order traversal on the input tree. We start from the smallest value in the BST (the leftmost node), and keep moving towards the right until we reach the largest value (the rightmost node). During this process, we update the `right` pointer of each visited node to point to its successor (the next larger node). We also keep track of the current node (`self.cur`) to update it as we visit more nodes. Finally, we return the new root of the rearranged tree (the successor of the original root).

Note that we initialize `self.cur` to a dummy node before starting the in-order traversal, and we return `ans.right` because `ans` is our dummy node and `ans.right` is the first real node in the rearranged tree.

This solution assumes that the `TreeNode` class is defined as follows:

```python

```
This solution works by first sorting the digits of the input number. Then it generates a list of all possible sorted strings representing powers of 2. If the sorted input number is in this list, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. The bit shift operator (`<<`) is used to generate the power of 2.

Note that this solution assumes that the input number is within the constraints specified in the problem statement. If the input number could be larger than 10^9, you would need to adjust the range of the power of 2 values generated in the list comprehension.

This solution uses breadth-first search to find the shortest path between two states. The state is represented by the string `A`, and each neighbor is obtained by making a swap operation. For each state, its distance is recorded in the `seen` dictionary. If a neighbor has not been visited before, it is added to the queue. The function `neighbors` generates all possible states that can be reached from the current state by swapping two letters.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n!) as in the worst case scenario, we need to explore all possible states. The space complexity is also O(n!) due to the usage of the queue and the `seen` dictionary.

Please note that this solution may not work for larger inputs due to the time complexity.

Explain the code in simple terms:

This code defines a class Solution with two methods, maskEmail and maskPhoneNumber. These methods take a string as input and return a masked version of the string according to the rules described in the problem statement.

The main method, maskPII, checks if the input string contains an "@" symbol. If it does, it calls the maskEmail method; otherwise, it calls the maskPhoneNumber method.

In the maskEmail method, the string is split into a name and domain at the "@" symbol. The name is then transformed to lowercase and the middle characters are replaced by asterisks. The method returns the transformed name, an "@" symbol, and the domain in lowercase.

In the maskPhoneNumber method, all non-digit characters in the string are removed, leaving only the digits. The method then constructs a masked phone number string based on the length of the digits string. If the length is greater than 10, the country code is replaced by asterisks. The method returns the masked phone number string.

This code works by iterating over the list of numbers, and for each number it checks whether the previous one is smaller. If so, it increments the counter `inc`, which represents the length of the current increasing subarray. This counter is then added to the result `res`, which keeps track of the total number of increasing subarrays. The function returns the total number of increasing subarrays after iterating through all elements in the list.

        return max_width
```
In this solution, we first use a stack to store the indices of the numbers that are in non-increasing order. Then we iterate over the array from right to left, for each number, we pop out all the indices from the top of the stack that have smaller values than the current number, and calculate the maximum width of the ramp ending at the current index. This way, we ensure that the start of the ramp is as small as possible. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

```

The code above works by first determining the number of common prefix bits between the two input integers. It does this by continuously right shifting both integers until they become equal. This gives us the highest order bit where the two integers differ. The variable 'shift' stores this value.

Then it returns the result by left shifting the original left integer by 'shift' bits. This restores the common prefix to the left of the least significant bits, and zeroes out the rest of the bits.

This approach works because the bitwise AND operation is commutative (i.e., changing the order of the operands does not change the result). Therefore, we can always assume that the common prefix will be the same for any pair of integers. By finding the common prefix, we can determine the remaining bits after performing the bitwise AND operation.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), since the number of iterations is constant regardless of the size of the input integers. The space complexity is also O(1), as no additional space is used.

This Python solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to find the maximum score. The DFS function returns two values: the maximum sum of the subtrees including the current node and the total sum of the subtrees including the current node. The maximum score is updated during the DFS traversal. The time complexity is O(n), as each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(n), as the DFS stack and the graph adjacency list are used.

```

This solution works by sorting the items in descending order based on their value per unit weight. Then, it iterates through each item, adding as much of it as possible to the knapsack without exceeding its capacity. If the knapsack is completely filled, it returns the total value. If the knapsack cannot fit any more items, it returns -1.

This is a DFS approach. Firstly, we create an adjacency list representation of the tree. Then we start our depth-first search from node 0 (assuming it as the root). For each node, we traverse its unvisited neighbors, recursively call the dfs function on them and accumulate their counts into a dictionary. We then update the result list at the current node with the maximum count of the current label. After the dfs function finishes, we return the count dictionary back to its parent node. If the parent node needs to use this count information, it will do so by looking up the result list at the current node.

This solution works because it visits each node only once, and each node only does a constant amount of work. Thus, the time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n).

This solution works by using a stack to keep track of the next greater/smaller number for each number in the array. For each number, we calculate the number of subarrays it can be the maximum or minimum by multiplying the number of subarrays containing numbers smaller/larger than it to its left and right respectively. Finally, we sum up these products to get the total number of subarrays.The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as we iterate through the array twice. The space complexity is also O(n) for storing the results.

```

In this solution, we use a stack to keep track of the previous books. The stack stores tuples, where the first element is the number of books at the current position, and the second element is the index of the previous book. For each book, we pop out all the books whose number of pages are larger than the current book from the top of the stack, calculate the maximum number of books we can take, and push the current book into the stack. Finally, we return the maximum number of books we can take.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are iterating through each character in the string exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case scenario, we will end up pushing every character onto the stack.

        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
```

The code should be written inside the `exist()` function of this class.

**Explanation:**
This problem can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) technique. We will iterate through each cell in the grid and if we find the first character of the word, we start searching for the rest of the word by recursively calling the DFS function on all its neighbors. If any of the recursive calls returns True, we return True as well. Otherwise, we mark the current cell as False to avoid revisiting it.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def exist(self, board, word):
        self.board = board
        self.word = word
        self.directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if self.dfs(i, j, 0):
                    return True
        return False

    # dfs function
    def dfs(self, i, j, k):
        if self.board[i][j] != self.word[k]:
            return False
        elif k == len(self.word) - 1:
            return True

        # mark the visited cell
        tmp, self.board[i][j] = self.board[i][j], '/'
        res = any(self.dfs(i + di, j + dj, k + 1) for di, dj in self.directions)
        self.board[i][j] = tmp
        return res
```

In this solution, we first check whether the first character of the word exists in the grid or not. If yes, then we start searching for the rest of the word by calling the dfs function on all its neighbors. We use a directions array to store the possible movements (up, down, left, right). If any of the recursive calls
ref:
def exist(board, word):
    m, n = len(board), len(board[0])

    def dfs(i, j, k):
        if not 0 <= i < m or not 0 <= j < n or board[i][j] != word[k]:
            return False
        if k == len(word) - 1:
            return True

        tmp, board[i][j] = board[i][j], '/'
        res = dfs(i + 1, j, k + 1) or dfs(i - 1, j, k + 1) or dfs(i, j + 1, k + 1) or dfs(i, j - 1, k + 1)
        board[i][j] = tmp
        return res

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if dfs(i, j, 0):
                return True
    return False

This python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `trimBST` which takes a `TreeNode` object and two integers as input and returns a `TreeNode` object. The method first checks if the root is `None`, if it is, it returns `None`. If the root's value is greater than `high`, it recursively calls itself with the left child of the root and the same bounds. If the root's value is less than `low`, it does the same but with the right child. Otherwise, it sets the left and right children to the results of recursive calls with the corresponding children and the same bounds, then returns the root.

This is a basic implementation of a hashset using array and linked list. The primary idea behind this is to use two functions `hash` and `pos` to convert the given key into bucket number and position in that bucket respectively. Then we use an array as a simple hash table where each cell can contain a linked list of keys.

In `add` method, we find the corresponding bucket for the given key, and add the key at the appropriate position in the linked list.

In `remove` method, we find the corresponding bucket for the given key, and remove the key from the linked list.

In `contains` method, we find the corresponding bucket for the given key, and check if the key exists in the linked list.

The time complexity of all methods are O(1).

This solution uses a dynamic programming approach. The dp array represents the minimum ascii sum of deleted characters to make s1[i:] and s2[j:] equal. If s1[i] == s2[j], then no character is deleted. Otherwise, we have two options, delete s1[i] or s2[j]. We choose the option that gives us the smallest ascii sum.
The time complexity of this solution is O(mn), where m and n are lengths of s1 and s2 respectively. The space complexity is also O(mn).

The BFS keeps track of the current state, the index of the zero tile, and the number of moves made so far. For each possible move, it generates the new state and adds it to the queue if it has not been seen before.

            res ^= start + 2 * i * 2
        return res
```

This solution is also giving correct output but it's not efficient as compared to previous one because in each iteration we are doing more operations.

Is there any way to optimize this solution or is it already optimal?

The best time complexity would be O(1).

Please help me to understand how to optimize this solution.

I have tried many things but couldn't get a clear idea.

Thanks in advance.


A: The key to this problem is understanding that the XOR operation has some properties:

1. XOR is commutative (a XOR b = b XOR a)
2. Each element XOR itself gives 0 (a XOR a = 0)
3. Any number XOR 0 is the number itself (a XOR 0 = a)

By applying these properties, you can simplify the XOR operation over the sequence of numbers.

Here is an optimized Python solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int
ref:
def findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d):
    count = 0
    for i in arr1:
        valid = True
        for j in arr2:
            if abs(i - j) <= d:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    return count

This Python code uses the sliding window technique along with a counter to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string. The goal is to find the smallest substring that can be replaced to make the string balanced. The function `balancedString` first calculates the total number of each character in the string and then iterates over the string to find the smallest substring that makes the string balanced. It keeps track of the start and end indices of the current substring and updates the result whenever it finds a smaller balanced substring. The function returns the length of the smallest balanced substring.

# Testing the code
sol = Solution()
print(sol.balancedString("QWER")) # Output should be 0
print(sol.balancedString("QQWE")) # Output should be 1

The solution uses a dictionary to map the random integer generated to the corresponding position in the matrix. The key idea here is that we don't actually need to flip the value at the picked position, we just need to track which positions have been picked. After picking a position, we replace the picked position with the last unpicked position (if any), so that we can reuse the picked position for the next pick. This way, we avoid unnecessary operations and reduce the number of random function calls.

The time complexity is O(1) for both flip and reset operations, as we perform constant time operations. The space complexity is also O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

```
This Python solution uses a dictionary (hashmap) to keep track of the cumulative sums encountered so far and their counts. The key-value pair in the dictionary is "cumulative sum": "count". Initially, the cumulative sum is 0 and its count is 1 (since we have encountered it once).

In each iteration, we add the current number to the cumulative sum and check if there is any cumulative sum in the hashmap that subtracted by `k` equals the current cumulative sum. If yes, we increment the count by the count of such cumulative sum.

Finally, we return the count.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`, because we traverse the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), since in the worst case scenario (when all numbers are distinct), we might end up storing all the cumulative sums in the hashmap.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to iterate over all the nodes in the input list twice (once to create the set of child nodes, once to find the root node). The space complexity is O(n) because it stores the child nodes in a set.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list represents the entire tree and does not contain any cycles. If the input list represents only a part of the tree, then the solution would need to be modified to handle this case.

generated:

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums):
        # your code here
```

and you should implement it like this:

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums):
        result = []
        if (len(nums) == 1):
            return [nums[:]]

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            n = nums.pop(0)
            perms = self.permute(nums)
            
            for perm in perms:
                perm.append(n)
            result.extend(perms)
            nums.append(n)
        return result
```

This solution uses backtracking to generate all permutations. It pops the first element from the list and generates all permutations for the remaining elements. Then it appends the popped element at the end of each permutation generated for the remaining elements. Finally, it extends the result by these permutations. This ensures that all permutations are generated. The base case for recursion is when there is only one element left in the list, in which case it returns a copy of the list.

Note: The time complexity of this solution is O(n * n!) because for every n elements we have n possibilities to put them in the first position, then for the remaining n-1 elements we have (n-1) possibilities to put them in the second position and so on. So, the total number of operations is n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1 = n factorial which is n \* n. The space complexity is also O(n * n!) because in the worst case we will store n factorial permutations.

The solution provided assumes that the input list doesn't contain any duplicate numbers. If the input list could contain duplicates, the solution would need to be modified to handle this case.

                    res.append(topLeft)
        return res
```

This solution gives incorrect output. It seems like the DFS approach is not correct. Please guide me through the correct approach.

I am trying to understand the logic behind it. The idea is to start DFS from every unvisited cell which contains 1 and mark all visited cells in the process. For each DFS call, we need to find the top left and bottom right corners. We do this by recursively calling DFS on the neighboring cells and updating our corners accordingly.

However, the current implementation does not seem to work as intended.

I appreciate your help in understanding the issue.

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes an array `dp` of size `n+1` with all elements as `0`. Then it iterates over the questions list in reverse order. For each question, it calculates the maximum points that can be earned by either skipping the current question or solving the current question. The maximum points earned so far is stored in `dp[i]`. Finally, it returns `dp[0]` which represents the maximum points that can be earned starting from the first question.

        return total_shifts <= k
```
This solution works by counting the number of shifts needed for each position in `s` to match the corresponding character in `t`. It then calculates the total number of shifts required across all positions, and checks if this total is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Note that the conversion from ASCII to integer and vice versa is done using Python's built-in `ord` function, which returns an integer representing the Unicode character, and the `chr` function, which does the reverse. The modulo operator (`%`) is used to wrap around the shifts when necessary.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of `s`, because it needs to traverse `s` once to count the shifts. The space complexity is also O(n), because it uses an array of size 26 to store the counts of the shifts.

The solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp` array stores the minimum number of operations needed to sort the subarray from index `i` to `j`. If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means we need to replace `nums[j]` with some numbers to make it non-decreasing, and the number of operations is `dp[i][j] = 1`. Then, we iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`, and update `dp[i][j]` by considering all possible positions `k` between `i` and `j`. If `nums[k] < nums[j]`, we can replace `nums[j]` with `nums[k]` and the number of operations is `dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] +

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) on both trees simultaneously. It first traverses all the nodes in the first tree and adds their values to a set. Then it traverses all the nodes in the second tree, and for each node, it checks if its complement (i.e., `target - node.val`) exists in the set. If it does, then we have found a pair that sums up to the target, so we return True. Otherwise, we continue traversing the second tree. If we finish traversing the second tree without finding a pair, we return False.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n and m are the numbers of nodes in the first and second trees respectively. This is because we perform DFS on each tree once. The space complexity is also O(n + m), as in the worst case we might need to store all the nodes from both trees in the set.

```

This solution works by checking if the string `s` is equal to its reverse (which would mean it's a palindrome). If it is, we return `1` because we can remove all occurrences of `s` in one step. If it's not a palindrome, we return `2` because we need at least two steps: first remove all 'b's, then remove all 'a's.

This is because to remove a palindrome, we can just remove the subsequence of 'a's or 'b's, which will take one step each. So, we need at least two steps to remove the whole string.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input string `s` consists only of letters 'a' and 'b'. If there might be other characters, additional error checking should be added.

#explain how this code works
The function `getMinDistance` takes three arguments: a list of integers `nums`, an integer `target`, and an integer `start`. The function returns the minimum absolute difference between any index `i` where `nums[i]` equals `target` and `start`.

The function uses a generator expression within the `min` function to iterate over each index `i` and corresponding value `n` in `nums`. If `n` equals `target`, it calculates the absolute difference between `i` and `start` and includes it in the generator expression.

The `min` function then returns the smallest of these differences. This is the minimum absolute difference between any indices where `nums[i]` equals `target`.

For example, if `nums` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], `target` is 5, and `start` is 3, the function would calculate the differences 1 (abs(0 - 3)), 2 (abs(1 - 3)), and 3 (abs(2 - 3)). It would return 1 because it's the smallest of these differences.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of `nums`, because it needs to iterate over all elements of `nums` once.

This solution has a space complexity of O(1), because it doesn't use any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input.

        return sum(even[-k:]) + sum(odd)
```
This solution first checks if there exists an even number in nums. If not, it returns -1. Then it sorts the numbers into even and odd arrays. If the number of even numbers is less than k, it returns the sum of the last k odd numbers plus the sum of all even numbers. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the last k even numbers plus the sum of all odd numbers.

This solution works because it tries to maximize the sum of the even numbers and minimize the sum of the odd numbers. The reason why it minimizes the sum of the odd numbers is that we can always replace one odd number with an even number to make the total sum even.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation and a space complexity of O(n) for storing the even and odd numbers.

Please note that this problem can be solved more efficiently using a priority queue or heap data structure, but the current solution is simpler and easier to understand.

                second = odds.pop()
                sum += first + second

This is a recursive solution that works by checking the values of the left and right children of the current node. If either child has the same value as the current node, we recurse on that child. If not, the child's value is the smallest value in its subtree. We keep track of the smallest and second smallest values found so far, and return the second smallest value when we're done. If no second smallest value exists, we return -1.

Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        count = 0
        candidate = None

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

        return candidate
```

This code uses the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which is a linear time complexity O(n). The algorithm works by keeping a count of the current candidate and decrementing it whenever it encounters a different number. If the count reaches zero, it sets the current number as the new candidate. This process ensures that the current candidate is the majority element since it has appeared more than half the time. At the end of the loop, the candidate is the majority element.

def majority_element(nums):

```

Explaination:

This problem can be solved by using Union Find data structure. We can create a map 'graph' where key is a string and value is a list [parent, multiplier]. Parent is initially itself, and multiplier is the ratio from parent to current node.

We iterate over each equation and value, if they are not in graph, add them into graph with initial parent as themselves and multiplier as 1. Then we call union function to merge x and y into one group. The multiplier between x and y is calculated by dividing value.

During the union process, we also check whether the multiplier between x and y is more than 1e-5 (the threshold for considering two floating point numbers equal) at any point. If so, it means there is a contradiction, so we return True immediately.

If we finish all unions without finding any contradictions, we return False.

This solution uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the longest substring with at most two distinct characters. The left and right pointers of the window are moved based on the number of distinct characters found. When more than two distinct characters are found, the left pointer is moved until there are only two distinct characters left in the window. The maximum length of the window is updated whenever a longer window is found. This continues until the end of the string. The time complexity is O(n) as each character is visited once, and the space complexity is O(1) as the number of distinct characters stored in the counter dictionary will never exceed 2.

After all nodes have been visited, it checks if `x` and `y` have the same depth and different parents. If so, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

I am looking for a solution in python code without any explanation.

```python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        dic = {}
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            if v in dic and i - dic[v] <= k:
                return True
            dic[v] = i
        return False
```

This code is based on the sliding window concept of maintaining a dictionary which stores the most recent index of each element. When we encounter a duplicate, we check whether its index difference is less than or equal to k. If yes, then we return True, else we continue to the next element. If no duplicate found within k distance, we remove the first element from the dictionary and continue to process. If we finish iterating over all elements, no duplicate found, we return False.

Note: This problem is a variation of the "Contains Duplicate" problem where we need to find duplicates within a certain range (k). The main difference here is that instead of checking for duplicates anywhere in the array, we are checking for duplicates within a specific range (k).

Also note that this solution uses the fact that Python's dictionary maintains the insertion order since version 3.7. This property is used to implement the sliding window.

s = Solution()
print(s.expand("{a,b}c{d,e}f"))  # Output: ['acdf', 'acef', 'bcdf', 'bcef']
print(s.expand("abcd"))  # Output: ['abcd']
```

This code works by first parsing the input string to identify groups of characters. It does this by keeping track of whether it's inside braces or not. When it encounters a brace, it starts a new group. When it encounters a comma, it simply skips that character. Otherwise, it adds the character to the current group. After parsing the input string, it uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of these groups. It then joins these combinations together into strings and sorts them before returning them.

    def catchMaximumPeople(self, team: List[int], dist: int) -> int:
        # Write your code here
        pass
```

This is a problem of sliding window and greedy algorithm. The basic idea is to use a sliding window to maintain a range of people who can be caught by each "it" person. For each "it" person, we try to extend the range as far as possible without crossing the distance limit. We also need to ensure that we do not overlap with other "it" people. This can be achieved by using a priority queue to store the potential positions of the next "it" person.

Here is the Python code:

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def catchMaximumPeople(self, team: List[int], dist: int) -> int:
        n = len(team)
        it_positions = [i for i in range(n) if team[i] == 1]
        it_count = len(it_positions)
        j = 0
        max_catch = 0
        pq = []
        
        for i in range(-dist, n+dist):
            while j < it_count and it_positions[j] < i - dist:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (-it_positions[j], it_positions[j]))
                j += 1
            while pq and pq[0][1] < i:
                heapq.heappop(pq)
            if pq and pq[0][1] >= i - dist and pq[0][1] <= i + dist:
                max_catch += 1
                heapq.heappop(pq)
                
        return max_catch
```

This code firstly finds all the positions of "it" people and sorts them. Then for each position `i` in the range from `-dist` to `n+dist`, it tries to extend the range as far as possible without crossing the distance limit. If a "it" person can catch someone at position `i`, it increases the count of caught people and removes this potential catch from the priority queue. Finally, it returns the maximum number of people that the "it" people can catch.

        n = len(nums)
        missing = []
        
        for i in range(2**n):

                missing.append(binary)
                
        return missing[0]
```
This solution works by generating all possible binary strings of length `n` (which is equal to 2^n), and checking if they exist in `nums`. If they don't, we add them to the `missing` list. Since we know that `nums` contains unique binary strings, the first missing string we find will be the one we're looking for. We return this string.

Please note that this solution can be slow for large inputs because it generates 2^n binary strings. If you need a more efficient solution, you might want to consider other approaches.

```

This solution uses a max heap to keep track of the maximum value in the piles. We then pop the maximum value from the heap, remove half of its value, and push the remaining value back into the heap. This process is repeated `k` times. Finally, we return the sum of all the values in the heap.

Please note that we use negative values to simulate a max heap because Python does not have a built-in max heap data structure.

Above code is the Python solution for the problem. The `MaxStack` class has a constructor to initialize the stack and max_stack. The `push` method appends the element at the end of both the stack and max_stack. It ensures that the max_stack always holds the current maximum value. The `pop` method removes and returns the last element from both the stack and max_stack. The `top` method returns the last element from the stack. The `peekMax`

This is a simple implementation of the problem using Python. We store the logs in a list and then use a comparison operation based on the granularity to filter out the desired logs. The `len_map` dictionary helps us to determine up to which index of the timestamp we need to compare.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of logs stored, since we may potentially need to go through all logs if there are no matches. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the space used by the list to store the logs.
Please note that this solution assumes that all input strings are valid and in the correct format. If such validation is needed, it would need to be added to the code.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Above python code will solve the problem as per the constraints provided. The idea here is to use a counter to keep track of the balance of the string. When the balance becomes 0, we increment the result by one.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store our counters and variables.

```

Solution class should have a method inside it named `isPalindrome` which checks if a given string is palindrome or not.

Next, we will use backtracking to solve this problem. We will start from the beginning of the string and for each character, we will check if it can form a palindrome or not. If yes, then we will add it to our current partition and recursively call the function for the remaining string.

Finally, we will return all the possible partitions.

Here is the complete Python code for the above explanation:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def partition(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        def isPalindrome(s):
            return s == s[::-1]
        
        def backtrack(start, path):
            # If the starting index is equal to the length of the string,
            # we have found a valid partition
            if start == len(s):
                result.append(path)
                return
            for i in range(start+1, len(s)+1):
                # If the substring from start to i is a palindrome
                if isPalindrome(s[start:i]):
                    # Add the substring to the path and continue the backtracking
                    backtrack(i, path + [s[start:i]])
                    
        result = []
        backtrack(0, [])
        return result
```

This code will return all possible palindrome partitions of the input string `s`. The time complexity of this code is O(n * 2^n) where n is the length of the string `s` because in the worst case scenario, we might have to go through all the substrings of the string. The space complexity is also O(n * 2^n) as in the worst case, we might end up storing all the substrings of the string in the result list.

ref:
def isPalindrome(s, start, end):
    while start < end:

Firstly, we need to identify the node that has a right child pointing to the node that should be removed. This can be done using a breadth-first search (BFS). Start at the root and iterate through each level of the tree. If a node has a right child pointing to the target node, remove the connection between them.

Secondly, once all connections have been removed, the target node itself should also be removed. This can be done by using a depth-first search (DFS) to find the target node and remove it along with any descendants.

This approach ensures that the node that is incorrectly pointed to is removed first, then the rest of the tree is corrected.

I need the solution for this problem.

This is a hard problem from leetcode and I am trying to solve it by myself but I can't figure out how to approach it. Can anyone help me understand the approach or give a hint to solve this problem?


A: This problem is a combination of several algorithms and techniques. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you might take to approach it:

1. First, realize that the problem can be broken down into two parts: constructing the tree structure and performing queries.

2. To construct the tree, you can use an adjacency list representation. Start by initializing an empty adjacency list of size n. For each edge, add it to both lists.

3. Next, you will need to perform Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the root (assume 0 as root in this case). This will help you find the distances from the root to all other nodes.

4. Afterwards, you can perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from each query node. The goal here is to find the shortest path to the start and end nodes. Keep track of the minimum distance to the current node during the BFS. If you encounter a node that has already been visited and is closer to the query node than the current minimum, update the minimum.

5. Return a list of minimum distances for each query.

Here is some pseudo-code that illustrates these steps:

```
function closestNode(n, edges, query):
    # Step 1: Construct the tree
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    
    # Step 2: Perform DFS to get distances from root to all nodes
    dist = [-1] * n
    parent = [-1] * n
    stack = [(0, -1)]  # Start DFS from node 0 with parent -1
    while stack:
        node, p =
ref:
from collections import deque

def closest_nodes(n, edges, query):
    answer = []
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    
    for edge in edges:
        tree[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        tree[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    
    def bfs(start, end):
        queue = deque([start])
        visited = {start}
        
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            
            if current == end:
                return current
            
            for neighbor in tree[current]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    visited.add(neighbor)
    
    for q in query:
        lca = bfs(q[0], q[1])
        node1 = bfs(lca, q[0])
        node2 = bfs(lca, q[1])
        answer.append(q[0] if node1 == q[2] else q[1])
    
    return answer

This solution is correct but it is not efficient enough because of the nested loops and the use of the 'set' data structure. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2).

Question 2:You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You should construct `k` non-overlapping palindrome strings using all the characters in `s`. Return _`True`_ if it is possible to construct `k` palindrome strings using all the characters in `s` and `False` otherwise.
<jupyter_code>
**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "annb", k = 2
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** You can construct two palindromes using all characters in s. Some possible solutions include "anna" and "nb".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "leetcode", k = 3
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Even if you try all possible solutions, there will always be more than one character left over.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "true", k = 4
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The simplest solution is to use a single character to construct 4 palindromes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= k <= 10^5`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

        return ans
```

This code works by counting the frequency of each character in the string `s`. Then it iterates over these counts and adds up the maximum number of characters that can be used to form a palindrome. If there is a single character that appears an odd number of times (which can be put in the middle of the palindrome), we add one to the total length. This ensures that we can use at least one character to form a palindrome.
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, because we have to iterate over all characters in `s` once. The space complexity is also O(n), because we store the count of each character in `s`.

def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> int:
    charCount = [0] * 128

        week_days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
        return week_days[date.weekday()]
```

This Python code uses the built-in `datetime` module to create a date object. Then it returns the day of the week based on the index returned by the `weekday()` method of the date object. Note that `weekday()` returns an integer between 0 (representing Monday) and 6 (representing Sunday), so we use this to index into our list of days.

The `weekday()` function works under the concept of a "week starting on Monday". So if you want to start your week from "Sunday" then you have to subtract 1 from the result of `weekday()`.

Note: This code will work in Python 3.4 and above because the `datetime` module was introduced in Python 3.4.

It's worth mentioning that the `datetime` library is available in all versions of Python, but not all versions of Python come with the `calendar` library. If you're using Python 2.x and don't have access to the `calendar` library, you may need to install it separately. You can do this with pip:

```bash
pip install python-dateutil
```

And then you can use `from dateutil.weekday import weekday` instead of `from datetime import datetime`.

This code works by maintaining two pointers, `l` and `r`, to represent the range of characters in `s`. It also maintains a counter array to record the frequency of each character in `s`. The `stack` is used to simulate the process of giving characters to the robot and writing them on paper. The `res` list stores the characters written on paper. The main logic of the code is in the while loop where it keeps popping characters from the stack and appending them to `res` as long as the top of the stack is lexicographically smaller than the smallest character in the remaining part of `s`. If the top of the stack is larger or equal, it continues to push characters into the stack until the top of the stack is lexicographically smaller.

This solution works by traversing down the tree from root to a leaf node. If the node we are currently at is less than p, we know that this node cannot be the successor and can safely skip it. If the node is greater than p, we update our candidate successor and move to its left child. This way, we ensure that the first node we hit that is greater than p will be our answer. We continue this process until we reach a node where we can't go left anymore (i.e., we have found p or reached a leaf node). At this point, our successor will be the node we have traversed through.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case scenario, we may end up visiting all the way down to the leaf node. The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

Note: The Node class is as follows:

```python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, parent=None):

        self.left = left

This code first sorts the input list. Then it iterates through the sorted list, and for each element, if it's not greater than its previous element, it adds the difference plus one to the result and sets the current element to the previous element plus one. This ensures that all elements are unique by increasing the current element if necessary. The total number of increments needed is returned as the result.

The solution class should have a method called `sortTransformedArray` that takes in an array of numbers `nums`, and two more parameters `a`, `b` and `c`. The function should return a new array where each element is transformed according to the quadratic function `f(x) = ax2 + bx + c` and the array is sorted in ascending order.

Solution:

def transform(x, a, b, c):
    return a * x * x + b * x + c

This solution works by using two pointers approach. One pointer starts from the beginning of the array and the other from the end. We then determine which number will be added first based on whether `a` is positive or negative. This is because in the case of positive `a`, the

This code works by using depth-first search to find the connected component containing the initial point (`row`, `col`), and then changes the border cells of this component to the new color. The `dfs` function returns `True` when it reaches the boundary of the grid or a cell of a different color. If the sum of the return values from the four recursive calls is less than 4, it means the current cell is on the border of the connected component, so we change its color back to the original color.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortString(self, s: str) -> str:
        pass
```

Please provide python code to solve this problem.

I tried solving this problem by sorting the string and then using a while loop to append the smallest and largest character alternatively until there are no characters left in the string. But that did not work as expected. It did not pass all test cases. 

The correct approach would be to use collections.Counter to count the frequency of each character and then using a while loop to iterate through the counter and append the smallest and largest character alternatively until all characters have been appended.

Here is the correct Python code:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def sortString(self, s: str) -> str:
        counter = Counter(s)
        result = []
        
        while counter:
            # Append smallest character and remove it from counter
            for c in sorted(counter):
                result.append(c)
                counter[c] -= 1
                if counter[c] == 0:
                    del counter[c]
                    
            # Append largest character and remove it from counter
            for c in sorted(counter, reverse=True):
                result.append(c)
                counter[c] -= 1
                if counter[c] == 0:
                    del counter[c]
        
        return ''.join(result)
```
This code works by repeatedly picking the smallest and largest remaining characters and appending them to the result. It does this until there are no more characters left in the counter. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operations, where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(n) because of the space used by the counter and the result list.

ref:
def numberOfSubarrays(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    result = count = 0
    odd_count = [0] * (n + 1)

    odd_count[0] = 1
    for num in nums:
        count += num % 2
        if count >= k:
            result += odd_count[count - k]
        odd_count[count] += 1

    return result

            else:
                i += 1
        return words
```

The above code works by iterating through the list of words. If the current word is an anagram of the previous word, it removes the current word. Otherwise, it moves on to the next word. The sorted function is used to sort the characters in each word, which allows us to easily compare them. This process continues until there are no more words left to check.

Note that this code modifies the input list in place. If you want to keep the original list, you should make a copy of it before starting to modify it.

ref:
def anagramOperations(words):
    i = 1
    while i < len(words):
        word1 = sorted(words[i])

        if word1 == word2:
            del words[i]
        else:
            i += 1
    return words

```python
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums):
        # your code here
```

and here is how I would solve this problem:

```python
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums):
        from functools import cmp_to_key
        nums = [str(x) for x in nums]
        nums.sort(key=cmp_to_key(lambda a, b: int(b+a) - int(a+b)))
        return ''.join(nums).lstrip('0') or '0'
```

In this solution, we convert each number to a string. Then we sort the array by a custom comparator that compares two strings by their concatenated value (b + a vs a + b). The most significant digit comes first, which will give us the largest number. If the resulting string is empty or starts with zeroes, we return '0'.

This solution works because Python's sort function uses Timsort, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). The custom comparator operation takes linear time, and since we perform this operation n times, the total time complexity becomes O(n^2 log n), which is still better than the brute-force approach of generating all permutations and comparing them, which would take O(n!).

I hope this explanation helps you understand the solution. Let me know if you have any questions about it.

ref:
from functools import cmp_to_key

def largestNumber(nums):
    def comparator(a, b):
        return -1 if a + b > b + a else int(a + b < b + a)

    nums_as_str = list(map(str, nums))
    nums_as_str.sort(key=cmp_to_key(comparator))
    return '0' if nums_as_str[0] == "0" else "".join(nums_as_str)

This class has two methods: `add` and `count`.

The `add` method takes a list of integers representing a point on the x-y plane, increments its counter in the dictionary `pt_cnt`, and appends it to the list `pts`.

The `count` method counts how many ways there are to form an axis-aligned square with the given point by iterating over every other point in the data structure. It checks whether the distance between the current point and the query point is equal (which means they are on the same line), but not the same (because we need different points). If this is true, then it multiplies the counts of the two points forming the diagonal of the square and adds them to the result.

The time complexity is O(n) for the `add` method and O(n^2) for the `count` method where n is the number of points added. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the points and their counts.

This solution works because when you have four points that can form a square, the points must satisfy the following conditions:

1. They must have the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate (i.e., they must lie on the same vertical or horizontal line).
2. The distances between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of these points must be equal (i.e.,

Your task is to write the Python code for this class.

Hint: You can use Python's built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values respectively. Also, you can use the slicing operation to split the list into two halves.

You can assume that the input will always satisfy the constraints specified in the problem statement.

Note: It's not necessary to handle the base case when the length of the list is 1. In this case, the function will simply return the single element in the list.

This problem is based on a coding challenge from LeetCode.

Solution:

Here is the Python code for the problem:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minMaxGame(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        while len(nums) > 1:
            newNums = [0] * (len(nums) // 2)
            for i in range(len(newNums)):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    newNums[i] = min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1])
                else:
                    newNums[i] = max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1])
            nums = newNums
        return nums[0]
```
In the above code, we first check if the length of the list is more than 1. If it is, we create a new list of half the size and apply the min-max rule alternatively between the pairs of elements. We continue this process until we get a list of size 1, which is then returned as the result.

This Python solution uses a Counter to count the number of words in each message sent by each sender. It then finds the maximum word count and creates a list of all senders who have this maximum word count. Finally, it returns the sender with the lexicographically largest name from this list.

This code works by iterating over the string `colors`, skipping the first and last characters. For each character, it checks whether it and its neighbors are the same color. If they are, it increments the count of that color's score. Finally, it returns whether Alice's score is greater than Bob's.

In Python, we use the `>` operator to compare the scores of Alice and Bob. The function will return `True` if Alice's score is greater than Bob's (meaning Alice wins), and `False` otherwise (meaning Bob wins).

This code uses a stack to keep track of the parentheses. When it encounters an open parenthesis, it pushes it onto the stack and updates the maximum length if necessary.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the string s. This is because we traverse the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case scenario, all the characters in the string could be open parentheses, pushing them onto the stack.

```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        pass
```

I am trying to solve this problem with the help of the below approach.

Approach:

Firstly, we need to calculate the degree of each node. Then, we sort the degrees in non-decreasing order. For each query, we will use binary search to find the number of pairs of nodes whose degree sum is greater than the current query. However, since we want to exclude the pairs where both nodes' degree is less or equal to the query, we need to subtract the number of pairs where either node's degree is less or equal to the query from the total number of pairs.

Please guide me on how to implement this approach in Python code.

This is my current code:

```python
from typing import List
from bisect import bisect_right
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Calculate degrees
        degrees = Counter(u+v for u, v in edges)
        sorted_degrees = sorted(degrees.values())
        
        # Binary search
        ans = []
        for q in queries:
            cnt = 0
            for d1 in degrees.values():
                if d1 <= q:
                    continue
                cnt += bisect_right(sorted_degrees, q + d1) - bisect_right(sorted_degrees, d1)
            ans.append(cnt // 2)
        return ans
```
But this code does not work correctly. Can you please correct it?

I have tried debugging but could not find the error.

This code works well for some test cases but fails for others. I am not able to understand what is wrong with it.

The time complexity of this code is O(n log n) which is acceptable as per the constraints provided.

I would really appreciate any kind of help here.

Thank you.

I need to generate python code for this problem.

I tried to solve this problem using DFS (Depth First Search) approach. I found the maximum depth and then used another function to find the node with maximum depth. But it didn't give correct result. 

I am not sure what is wrong with my approach. Can you please help me to write the correct Python code for this problem?

Please note that the input format is a list where the first index is the root node and next indexes are the left and right child of the root node respectively. If the child does not exist, it is represented by None. For example, the list `[1,2,3,4,5]` represents a tree like this:

```
     1
   /   \
  2     3
 / \
4   5
```

Here is how you can convert the list into a tree:

```python
def list_to_binary_tree(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None
    nodes = []
    for num in nums:
        if num is None:
            nodes.append(None)
        else:
            nodes.append(TreeNode(num))

    kids = nodes[::-1]
    root = kids.pop()
    for node in nodes:
        if node:
            if kids: node.left  = kids.pop()
            if kids: node.right = kids.pop()
    return root
```

You can use this function to convert your list to a tree and pass it to the `subtreeWithAllDeepest` function. For example:

```python
root = list_to_binary_tree([1,2,3,4,5])
print(Solution().subtreeWithAllDeepest(root)) # prints [2,7,4]
```

Here is my current implementation:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def subtreeWithAllDeepest(self, root):
        max_depth = -1
        def dfs(
ref:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_lca_util(root):
    if root is None:
        return None, 0

    left_lca, left_depth = find_lca_util(root.left)
    right_lca, right_depth = find_lca_util(root.right)

    if left_depth > right_depth:
        return left_lca, left_depth + 1
    elif left_depth < right_depth:
        return right_lca, right_depth + 1
    else:
        return root, left_depth + 1

def lca_deepest_leaves(root):

This Python code uses the SortedList data structure from the sortedcontainers module to maintain a sorted list of the current window of integers. It then iterates over the input list, adding the median of the current window to the result list, removing the first element of the window from the SortedList, and adding the next element from the input list. The median is calculated as the average of the middle elements of the SortedList (or the single middle element if the window size is odd).

        num_spaces = text.count(' ')
        if len(words) == 1:

        return (' ' * space_between_words).join(words) + ' ' * extra_spaces
```
In this solution, we first split the input string into words using the `split()` function. Then we count the number of spaces in the original string. If there is only one word, we simply append the spaces to the end of the word. Otherwise, we calculate how many spaces should go between words and how many extra spaces should be added at the end. We then join the words with the calculated number of spaces between them and add the extra spaces at the end.

This solution assumes that the input string has no leading or trailing spaces. If there are leading or trailing spaces, they need to be removed before splitting the string into words.

ref:
def reorderSpaces(text):
    spaces = text.count(' ')
    words = text.split()

    else:
        spaces_between_words = spaces // (num_words - 1)
    
    extra_spaces = spaces - spaces_between_words * (num_words - 1)

    return (' ' * spaces_between_words).join(words) + ' ' * extra_spaces

Explain how this code works in detail:

This Python code solves the problem using a technique called Prefix Sum and Hash Table. 

First, it initializes an empty list named 'prefix' of size len(nums) + 1. This list will be used to store the cumulative sum of elements in the 'nums' list up to each index.

Next, it initializes a defaultdict named 'count' to keep track of the frequency of these cumulative sums.

Then, it iterates over the 'nums' list to fill the 'prefix' list and update the 'count' dict. For each element

# Explanation: 
# In the first example, all possible substrings are "a", "ab", "aba", "b", "ba", and "a". The number of vowels in each substring is 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, and 1 respectively. So the total sum is 6.
# In the second example, all possible substrings are "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", and "c". The number of vowels in each substring is 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, and 0 respectively. So the total sum is 3.
# In the third example, there are no vowels in any substring, so the total sum is 0.

This code works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is a vowel, it calculates the number of substrings that end at this position and adds this number to the total sum. This is done by multiplying the number of positions before the current position (i+1) by the number of positions after the current position (n-i).

Please note that due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. Therefore, you should use a data type that can handle larger numbers, such as a long integer or a BigInteger in Java.

Also, the time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

    def minOperationsMaxProfit(self, customers: List[int], boardingCost: int, runningCost: int) -> int:

```


I am trying to solve this problem using a greedy approach. I will initialize a variable max_profit to keep track of the maximum profit, a variable curr_profit to keep track of the current profit, a variable total_wait to keep track of the total number of customers waiting, and a variable rotations to keep track of the number of rotations. Then, I will iterate through the customers list. For each iteration, I will add the number of customers arriving at this rotation to total_wait and update curr_profit based on whether there are enough customers to board the gondola or not. If there are enough customers, I will decrease total_wait by 4 and add 4 * boardingCost - runningCost to curr_profit. Otherwise, I will add total_wait * boardingCost - runningCost to curr_profit and set total_wait to 0. If curr_profit is greater than max_profit, I will update max_profit and store the current rotations count in result. Finally, if max_profit is still 0, I will return -1, otherwise return result.

Here is my Python code:

"""
This is a classic problem about trees and graph traversal.

The idea is to use two DFS traversals. First, we do a DFS to count the number of nodes in each subtree (including the root), and also calculate the total distance from the root to all other nodes in one DFS. Then, we do another DFS to update the answer for each node based on the information from the first DFS.

For each node, its distance from root is `root_distance - child_nodes_count + (n - child_nodes_count)`. Here, `child_nodes_count` is the number of nodes in the child subtree of this node, `n` is the total number of nodes, and `root_distance` is the distance from the root to this node in the first DFS.

This solution has time complexity O(N) because it needs to traverse all nodes twice.

```

This solution works by first checking if the current node is null (base case). If it is, we return true because an empty tree is balanced. Then we calculate the height of the left and right subtrees recursively. If the difference between these heights is greater than 1, we return false because the tree is unbalanced. Otherwise, we recursively check both the left and right subtrees.

In the helper function getHeight(), we also use a base case to handle the case where the node is null (which means the height of the subtree is 0). We then recursively calculate the maximum height of the left and right subtrees and add 1 to account for the root node.

Your solution should implement the logic inside the `minFallingPathSum` function.

```python
class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # initialize dp table
        for i in range(n):
            dp[0][i] = matrix[0][i]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(n):
                if j == 0:  # edge case: we can only fall to right
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j+1]) + matrix[i][j]
                elif j == n-1:  # edge case: we can only fall to left
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]) + matrix[i][j]
                else:  # we can fall to left, right or down
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j+1]) + matrix[i][j]

        return min(dp[-1])
```
This code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a dp table where each cell dp[i][j] stores the minimum sum of any falling path ending at position (i, j). For each cell, it considers the three possible positions above it (left, right, and directly below) and chooses the one with the smallest sum. Finally, it returns the minimum sum of all numbers in the last row of the dp table.

This code runs in O(n^2) time complexity and O(n^2) space complexity, where n is the size of the input matrix.

The above Python code is a solution to the problem. It uses two pointers (`i` and `j`) to iterate through the `start` and `target` strings respectively. The pointers skip any underscores ('_') until they point to either an 'L' or 'R' character. If they point to different characters at any point, the function returns `False`. If the character in `start` is 'L', it should be at a position less than or equal to the corresponding character in `target`. Similarly, if the character in `start` is 'R', it should be at a position greater than or equal to the corresponding character in `target`. If all these conditions are met, the function continues to the next characters in `start` and `target`. If the function has not returned `False` by the time it has checked all characters in `start` and `target`, it returns `True`.

You can assume that you can use `list` data structure in python and its built-in methods like `append()` and `pop()`.

The solution should be written inside the `addNegabinary` function.

Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def addNegabinary(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        carry = 0
        res = []
        while arr1 or arr2 or carry:
            if arr1:
                carry += arr1.pop()
            if arr2:
                carry += arr2.pop()
            res.append(carry & 1)
            carry = -(carry >> 1)
        while len(res) > 1 and res[-1] == 0:
            res.pop()
        return res[::-1]
```
In this solution, we start from the least significant bit (LSB), sum up the bits from `arr1` and `arr2`, and the carry from the previous step. We append the least significant bit of the sum to the result, and update the carry by right shifting it one bit. This process continues until there are no more bits left in both `arr1` and `arr2`, and the carry is zero. If the result has any trailing zeros, we remove them. The result is then reversed before being returned.

from collections import deque

def addNegabinary(arr1, arr2):

        carry = -(carry >> 1)

The key to this problem is understanding how a Skip List works and implementing it. We need to create a `Node` class to represent nodes in the skip list. A node has a value `val` and a list of next nodes `next`. The `next` list contains references to other nodes in the skip list, where the index of each reference

Please write your python code here:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumScore(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        left, right = k, k
        best = nums[k]
        current_min = nums[k]
        while left > 0 or right < n - 1:
            if (left == 0) or (right < n - 1 and nums[right + 1] >= nums[left - 1]):
                right += 1

            best = max(best, current_min * (right - left + 1))
        return best
```

This solution works by expanding the subarray from both sides towards the center, always keeping track of the minimum value in the current window. It then updates the maximum score whenever it finds a new maximum. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), as each element is visited at most twice.

I want you to write the whole solution including helper functions if necessary.

I am looking for the complete python code, without any explanations or comments.

I tried solving it myself but I am getting stuck at some point and can't seem to figure out how to solve it. I need help with the coding part only.

This is what I have so far:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def plusOne(self, head):
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        not_nine = dummy

        # Find the rightmost not-nine digit
        while head:
            if head.val != 9:
                not_nine = head
            head = head.next

        # Increment the rightmost not-nine digit by 1
        not_nine.val += 1
        not_nine = not_nine.next

        # Set all the following digits to 0
        while not_nine:
            not_nine.val = 0
            not_nine = not_nine.next

        return dummy.next if dummy.val else dummy.next
```

I am trying to understand why my current approach doesn't work.

The problem seems to be related to the handling of the carryover from the last digit. If the last digit is not 9, then it should be easy to increment it by 1 and we are done. However, if the last digit is 9, then we need to go back and increment the next digit and so on until we find a digit that is not 9. In this case, we need to set all the following digits to 0. This is what I don't

```python
class Solution:
    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums):
        pass
```

**Solution:**

```python
class Solution:
    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums):
        if nums == sorted(nums):
            return 0
        
        else:
            nums_sort = sorted(nums)
            start = 0
            while nums[start] == nums_sort[start]:
                start += 1
                
            end = len(nums) - 1
            while nums[end] == nums_sort[end]:
                end -= 1
                
            return end - start + 1
```

In this solution, we first check if the input list is already sorted. If it is, we return 0 since no subarray needs to be sorted. Otherwise, we create a sorted copy of the original list. We then find the starting and ending indices of the unsorted part of the original list by comparing elements from the original list and the sorted list. The difference between these indices (plus 1) gives the length of the shortest subarray that needs to be sorted.

ref:
def findUnsortedSubarray(nums):
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while start < len(nums) and nums[start] == sorted_nums[start]:
        start += 1
    while end > start and nums[end] == sorted_nums[end]:
        end -= 1
    return end - start + 1

This solution uses BFS to find the shortest path in the grid. The grid is traversed using a queue. If the current cell is the target cell, then the distance is returned. If the current cell is not the target cell, then all the neighboring cells are added to the queue. The distance is incremented by 1 for each level of the BFS traversal.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), because each cell is visited once. The space complexity is also O(n^2), because in the worst case, all cells can be added to the queue.

This is a recursive solution but it violates the follow-up constraints as it has a higher space complexity of O(n) due to the stack space utilized by recursion. Also, it does not meet the constant space complexity requirement.

Here is a Python solution that meets the follow-up constraints:

```python
class Solution:
    def printLinkedListInReverse(self, head: 'ImmutableListNode') -> None:
        nodes = []
        while head:

        for node in reversed(nodes):
            node.printValue()
```
This solution uses a list to store all the nodes in the linked list, which takes O(n) space. However, it traverses the linked list twice, so its time complexity is O(n). It meets the linear time complexity and less than linear space complexity requirement.

Please note that this solution requires the linked list to be mutable. If the linked list is immutable, we can't modify the nodes once they are created, and we can't store them in a list. We can still use the same approach of traversing the linked list twice, but we have to print the values while traversing the linked list in reverse order. This will take O(n) space but O(n) time.

```

In this code, we initialize two variables `res` and `cur` to 0. `res` will store our final result and `cur` will keep track of the length of the current substring. We iterate over the input string `s`. If the current character is the same as the previous one, we increment `cur` by 1; otherwise, we set `cur` to 1. Then we add `cur` to `res`. Finally, we return `res` modulo `10^9+7` to prevent overflow.

This solution works by keeping track of the length of the current run of homogeneous characters in `cur` and adding that length to the total count `res` at each step. When we encounter a new character, we reset `cur` to 1. By the end of the loop, `res` contains the total number of homogeneous substrings in `s`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, because we make a single pass over `s`. The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space.

# if s[i+k] < s[j+k], it means the substring starting at position j is lexicographically larger than the substring starting at position i, so we update i to be j and move j to the next position.
# if s[i+k] > s[j+k], it means the substring starting at position i is lexicographically larger than the substring starting at position j, so we move j to be j+k+1.

This python code uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of the hourglass in the given grid. It iterates through each possible starting position of the hourglass (with a window size of 3x3) and calculates the sum of the elements in the hourglass. The maximum sum is then returned.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n and m are the number of rows and columns respectively in the grid. This is because we are visiting every element in the grid once. The space complexity is O(1), since we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

This solution works by first dealing with the case where all elements in a column are 3 (both top and bottom cells are 1). Then, it deals with the case where all elements in a column are 2 (either both top and bottom cells are 1 or neither). Finally, it deals with the case where all elements in a column are 1 (either only top cell is 1 or only bottom cell is 1). If there are remaining upper and/or lower counts that couldn't be covered, it returns an empty list since such a configuration doesn't exist. Otherwise, it returns the constructed matrices.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input list `colsum` has at least one element. If that's not the case, you should add error checking at the beginning of your function.

This solution uses a backtracking algorithm to find all possible word squares. It starts by adding one word at a time to the word squares. For each new word, it checks if the current word squares form a valid word square. If it does, it continues to add more words. If it doesn't, it backtracks and removes the last added word. This process repeats until all words have been used.

The `buildPrefixMap` function builds a map from prefixes to words that start with these prefixes. This is used to quickly find words that could be candidates for the next word in the word square.

The `getWordsWithPrefix` function returns all words

Finally, it returns the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct averages.

"""
"""

"""
The Fisher-Yates algorithm generates a random permutation of a finite sequence. In our case, we have a list of numbers. We start from the last element, swap it with an element at a random index from 0 to i (where i is the current index), then decrement i. We continue this process until we reach the first element. This algorithm ensures that each permutation is equally likely.

Here is the Python code for Fisher-Yates shuffle:

def fisher_yates_shuffle(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)-1, 0, -1):

        def canSplit(mid):
            total, cnt = 0, 1

                if total + num > mid:
                    total = num

            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
```

This code uses binary search to find the smallest maximum sum that can be obtained from splitting the array into at most `m` subarrays. The `canSplit` function checks whether we can split the array into `m` subarrays with each subarray's sum less than or equal to `mid`. If we can, we try smaller values for `mid`; otherwise, we need larger values for `mid`.

The time complexity of this code is O(n log s), where n is the length of the input list and s is the sum of all elements in the list. This is because we perform binary search over the possible range of maximum sums, and for each possible maximum sum, we check whether we can split the array into `m` subarrays within O(n) time.

The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

    left, right = max(nums), sum(nums)

This solution works by iterating over all the words in the input list and checking if the current word is equal to the target. If it is, it calculates the minimum distance to reach the target by considering both moving left and moving right from the current index to the target index. The minimum of these two distances is stored in the variable 'res'. In the end, if 'res' is still its initial value (infinity), this means that the target was not found in the list, so the function returns -1; otherwise, it returns 'res'.

This code first counts the frequency of each character in the string using the Counter class from the collections module. It then creates a list of all these frequencies. The maximum frequency is found and an array of counters is created to keep track of how many characters have a certain frequency. Then for each count from the maximum down to 1, if there are more than one characters with that frequency, the number of deletions is increased by the difference between the current count and 1, and the excess count is added to the next lower count. Finally, the total number of deletions is returned.

```

This function works by first determining the maximum possible value for `m` (the base), which is when `log2(n+1)`. It then checks each `m` from `max_m` down to `2` to see if it can be a good base. If `m` is a good base, it will return it as the smallest good base. If no such `m` is found, it returns `n-1` as the smallest good base. The formula used to check if `m` is a good base is `(1-k^(m+1)) / (1-k) == n`. This formula is derived from the fact that the digits of `n` base `k` are all `1`'s if and only if `(1-k^(m+1)) / (1-k)` is an integer.

This solution uses binary search to find the target in the matrix. It converts the 2D index into a 1D index by using the formula `mid // cols` and `mid % cols`. If the middle element is less than the target, it means the target is in the right half of the array, so we update `lo` to `mid + 1`. If the middle element is greater than the target, it means the target is in the left half of the array, so we update `hi` to `mid`. If the middle element equals to the target, we return True. If we finish the loop without finding the target, we return False.

        res = []
        candidates.sort()

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            self.dfs(nums, target-nums[i], path+[nums[i]], res)
```
This solution works by trying every possible combination of numbers from the given list until the sum of the numbers equals the target. If the sum exceeds the target, it backtracks (removes the last number from the current combination) and tries again. When the sum equals the target, it adds the combination to the result list.

This solution has a time complexity of O(N^t), where N is the length of the candidates list and t is the target value. This is because in the worst case scenario, we need to try every possible combination of numbers. The space complexity is also O(N^t) as we need to store all possible combinations in the result list.

This solution does not work for large inputs due to its high time and space complexity. For larger inputs, a more efficient algorithm would be needed.

def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def findCombinations(startIndex, remaining):
        if remaining == 0:

```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
        pass
```

Your task is to implement this function to solve the problem.

Here is how you can solve it:

We will use a priority queue (heap) and sort the intervals by start time. Then we can keep track of the end time of each room. If a room gets free before the next meeting starts, we can reuse it. Otherwise, we need another room.

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        
        # Sort the intervals by start time
        intervals.sort()
        
        # Use a heap to keep track of the end time of each room
        heap = []
        
        # Add the first meeting's end time to the heap
        heapq.heappush(heap, intervals[0][1])
        
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            # If a room is free before the current meeting starts,
            # reuse it; otherwise, add a new room
            if heap[0] <= intervals[i][0]:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
                
            # Add the current meeting's end time to the heap
            heapq.heappush(heap, intervals[i][1])
        
        # The size of the heap is the minimum number of rooms needed
        return len(heap)
```

This code has a time complexity of O(N log N), where N is the number of meetings. This is because we are sorting the intervals and using a heap to keep track of the end times. The space complexity is O(N) as we may need to store all the end times in the heap.

ref:
import heapq

def minMeetingRooms(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return 0

    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    min_heap = [intervals[0][1]]
    for start, end in intervals[1:]:
        if start >= min_heap[0]:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, end)

    return len(min_heap)

This solution works by iterating through the list and counting how many times each number appears. If a number appears more than 25% of the time, it returns that number.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), because for each element in the list, we are scanning the entire list to count its occurrences. This can be improved to O(n) by using a hash map to store the counts of each number.

The space complexity is O(1), because we are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

Explain the code:

This code uses binary search to find the minimum possible x. It initializes the left and right boundaries as 1 and the maximum quantity of a product respectively. Then it enters a loop that continues until the left boundary is not equal to the right boundary. Inside the loop, it calculates the mid value and checks if the total number of products that can be distributed considering the mid value is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, it means the mid value is too small so it increases the left boundary to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, it decreases the right boundary to `mid`. Finally, it returns the left boundary as the result.

ref:

    sum_products = sum(quantities)

            if total + course[0] <= course[1]:
                # add the duration of this course to the heap
                heappush(heap, -course[0])
                # update the total time spent
                total += course[0]
            # if the current course can be taken after the previous ones, and it will end sooner than the longest one
            elif heap and heap[0] > -course[0]:
                # remove the longest course from the heap
                total += heappop(heap)

                heappush(heap, -course[0])
        return len(heap)
```
In this solution, we first sort the courses by their ending dates. Then we use a max heap to store the durations of the courses we have taken. For each course, if it can be taken within its deadline, we add its duration to the heap and update the total time spent. If the current course can be taken after the previous ones, and it will end sooner than the longest one, we remove the longest course from the heap and add the current course to the heap. Finally, the size of the heap is the maximum number of courses we can take.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of courses. The space complexity is O(n).

ref:
import heapq

def scheduleCourse(courses):
    courses.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    curr_time, duration_sum = 0, []

    for duration, deadline in courses:
        curr_time += duration
        heapq.heappush(duration_sum, -duration)

        if curr_time > deadline:
            curr_time += heapq.heappop(duration_sum)

    return len(duration_sum)

In this code, we use bitwise AND operator(&) to check if `n` and `n-1` have no common set bits. If they do, then `n` is a power of two. This is because when we subtract 1 from a power of two, all the bits in the original number become zero except for the least significant one which becomes a 0. Hence, bitwise AND of `n` and `n-1` would be 0. For example, consider n = 8 (which is 2^3). When we subtract 1 from it, we get 7 (binary representation: 111). Bitwise AND of 8 (1000) and 7 (0111) gives 0. Hence, 8 is a power of two.

```

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to solve the problem. We first create a directed graph where each edge points from a richer person to a poorer one. Then we start a DFS from each person and try to find the quietest person among his/her subordinates. If we find a person who is quieter than the current candidate, we update our result. Finally, we return the results list.

This code first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. Then it returns the maximum product of the three smallest numbers (which could be negative), or the product of the three largest numbers. This is because the product of the three largest numbers might be larger if those numbers are negative. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.

Write your code here:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findSubstring(self, s, words):
        if not s or not words: return []
        wordBag = Counter(words)
        wordLen, numWord = len(words[0]), len(words)
        totalLen, res = wordLen*numWord, []
        for i in range(len(s)-totalLen+1):

            if seen == wordBag:
                res.append(i)
        return res
```

This code works by first checking if there are any valid substrings we could possibly look for. If not, it immediately returns an empty list. Then it loops through each possible starting position for such a substring in the input string `s`. At each starting position, it slices out a substring of length `totalLen` (which is the sum of lengths of all the words). This substring is then split into words of length `wordLen` and counted using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. If this count matches the count of words in `wordBag`, it means that the current starting position is valid, so its index is added to the result list `res`. The function finally returns the list of starting positions.

ref:
from collections import Counter

def findSubstring(s, words):
    if not s or not words:
        return []

    word_count = Counter(words)

            current_word = s[i + j * word_length:i + (j + 1) * word_length]
            if current_word not in word_count:
                break
            temp_word_count[current_word] += 1
            if temp_word_count[current_word] > word_count[current_word]:
                break

```

This solution works by sorting the input ranges by their left endpoint, then iterating over them. If a range's left endpoint is greater than `max_right`, we know that no previous range can overlap with this one, so we double our current count of ways. Regardless of whether the range overlaps or not, we update `max_right` to be the maximum of its current value and the right endpoint of the current range.

This is a common technique for handling interval overlap problems, and it has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Note: This solution assumes that the ranges provided do not overlap initially. If they might overlap, you would need to handle that case separately.

The problem with this code is that it uses binary search to find the previous event that doesn't conflict with the current event. This could be optimized to O(logn) time complexity, but the problem requires us to implement it without using binary search.

In this code, we iterate over each bulb in the string `target`. If the bulb is not equal to the current state of the string `s` (which is stored in `current`), we increment `flips` by 1 and change the state of `s` to match the state of the bulb. Finally, we return the number of flips we made.

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        pass
```

Your task is to implement this function to solve the problem.

Here is how you can write your code:

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        from collections import defaultdict
        ans = defaultdict(list) # initialize a dictionary to store the results
        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26 # initialize a list to count the occurrence of each character in the string
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1 # increment the corresponding index in the count list
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s) # append the string to the list associated with the tuple of counts
        return ans.values()
```

In this code, we use a dictionary to group the anagrams. The keys of the dictionary are tuples representing the counts of each character in the strings. The values of the dictionary are lists containing the strings that are anagrams of each other. We iterate over the input list of strings, and for each string, we count the occurrences of each character and use this count as the key to add the string to the appropriate list in the dictionary. Finally, we return the values of the dictionary, which are the groups of anagrams.

ref:
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    anagram_map = defaultdict(list)

    for s in strs:
        key = ''.join(sorted(s))
        anagram_map[key].append(s)

    return list(anagram_map.values())

## Solution

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Firstly, we calculate the shortest path from the squirrel to each nut. Then we calculate the total distance the squirrel needs to walk to collect all the nuts. Finally, we calculate the distance from the tree to the last nut, which is added to the total distance.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

The solution should be within the class Solution and return an integer.

Do not change the function signature of the class or the return type.

Do not use any import statements.

Do not write any comments.

Do not print anything.

Only write the code that solves the problem.

This is a coding problem from LeetCode.

You can assume that the input will always be valid.

The problem can be solved using a priority queue or a heap data structure.

The idea is to keep track of the differences between the current flower count and the target count for each garden. We can then sort these differences in decreasing order and try to plant flowers in the gardens with the largest differences first. This ensures that we maximize the total beauty.

In Python, we can use the built-in `heapq` module to implement a min heap, which automatically sorts elements as they are added.

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxTotalBeauty(self, flowers: List[int], newFlowers: int, target: int, full: int, partial: int) -> int:
        diffs = []
        for flower in flowers:
            if flower < target:
                heapq.heappush(diffs, target - flower)
        
        total_beauty = 0
        while newFlowers > 0 and diffs:
            diff = heapq.heappop(diffs)
            to_plant = min(newFlowers, diff)
            newFlowers -= to_plant
            total_beauty += (target - (target - to_plant)) * partial
            
        if newFlowers > 0:
            total_beauty += newFlowers * partial
        
        total_beauty += len(flowers) * full
        return total_beauty
```

This solution works by first calculating the differences between the current flower count and the target count for each garden and storing them in a min heap. It then plants flowers in the gardens with the largest differences until there are no more flowers

    def maxCount(self, banned: List[int], n: int, maxSum: int) -> int:
        banned = set(banned)

                res += 1
                maxSum -= i
        return res
```
This code works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). For each number, it checks if it is not banned and if subtracting it from `maxSum` does not make `maxSum` negative. If both conditions are met, it increments the count of chosen numbers and subtracts the number from `maxSum`. This process continues until `maxSum` becomes less than the smallest remaining number. Finally, it returns the count of chosen numbers.

This Python code uses backtracking to solve the problem. The function `backtrack` takes two arguments: `ind` and `count`. `ind` is the current index in the `requests` list, and `count` is the total number of requests that have been picked so far.

In the function, we first check if `ind` is equal to the length of `requests`. If it is, we update `self.ans` with the maximum of `self.ans` and `count`. This is because we have reached the end of the `requests` list, and we have considered all possible requests.

Next, we consider the request at index `ind`. We decrease the count of the building that this request originates from, and increase the count of the building that this request leads to. Then, we check if all buildings have non-negative counts. If they do, we recursively call `backtrack` with `ind + 1` and `count + 1` as arguments. Otherwise, we undo our changes (i.e., restore the counts of the buildings). Finally,

The solution should be written inside the Solution class in Python.

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def wordPattern(self, pattern, s):
        map_char = {}
        map_word = {}

        words = s.split(' ')
        if len(words) != len(pattern):
            return False
        
        for p, w in zip(pattern, words):
            if p not in map_char:
                if w in map_word:
                    return False
                else:
                    map_char[p] = w
                    map_word[w] = True
            else:
                if map_char[p] != w:
                    return False
                
        return True
```

This solution works by maintaining two maps, one for mapping characters to words and one for checking if a word has already been mapped to a character. It iterates over the pattern and words simultaneously using the `zip()` function. If a character is encountered for the first time, it checks if the corresponding word has already been mapped to a different character. If so, it returns False. Otherwise, it adds the mapping to the maps. If a character is encountered again, it checks if the corresponding word is the same as the previous one. If not, it returns False. If all characters and words are processed without returning False, it returns True.

def word_pattern(pattern, s):
    words = s.split()
    if len(pattern) != len(words):

            word_map[word] = c

## Solution:

        patch, i, limit = 0, 0, 0
        while limit < n:
            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= limit + 1:
                limit += nums[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                limit += limit + 1
                patch += 1
        return patch
```

The idea behind this solution is to keep adding the smallest missing positive numbers until we reach the target number `n`. If we encounter a number in the array that is less than or equal to `limit + 1`, we can extend our range by adding this number to `limit`. Otherwise, we must add a new number to the array to reach the next expected number (`limit + 1`), and increase our patch count by 1. The variable `limit` keeps track of the maximum number that can be represented by the first `i` numbers in `nums` plus all the numbers added so far.

This solution runs in O(N) time where N is the length of `nums`. It also runs in O(1) space.

ref:
def minPatches(nums, n):
    max_sum = 0
    patches = 0
    i = 0

    while max_sum < n:
        if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= max_sum + 1:
            max_sum += nums[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            max_sum += max_sum + 1
            patches += 1

    return patches

The solution works by repeatedly subtracting the divisor from the dividend until the dividend becomes smaller than the divisor. The number of subtractions gives us the quotient. This method is much faster than repeated subtraction when the divisor is large. It uses bit manipulation to find the highest bit that fits into the dividend, and then subtracts twice that bit. It continues doing this until the dividend is less than the divisor.

```python

        stack = []
        max_area = 0
        index = 0
        
        while index < len(heights):
            if not stack or heights[index] >= heights[stack[-1]]:
                stack.append(index)
                index += 1
            else:
                top = stack.pop()
                if not stack:
                    area = heights[top] * index
                else:
                    area = heights[top] * (index - stack[-1] - 1)
                max_area = max(max_area, area)
                
        while stack:
            top = stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                area = heights[top] * index
            else:

            max_area = max(max_area, area)
            
        return max_area
```

This code works by maintaining a stack of indices of bars in the histogram. It iterates through the heights list from left to right, and for each bar, it calculates the maximum area that can be obtained by considering this bar as the shortest bar in the current histogram. If the stack is empty, it means that the current bar is the shortest so far, and its area is calculated as the height of the bar multiplied by the current index. If the stack is not empty, the area is calculated as the height of the top bar multiplied by the difference between the current index and the index of the bar at the top of the stack minus one. The maximum area encountered during this process is then returned as the result.

ref:
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    stack = []
    max_area = 0
    for i, h in enumerate(heights + [0]):
        while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > h:
            height = heights[stack.pop()]
            width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
        stack.append(i)

```
This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It maintains a 3D array `dp` where `dp[k][i][j]` represents the number of ways to roll `k` dice where the last two dice rolled are `i` and `j` respectively. For each `k`, it iterates over all possible `i` and `j` and updates the count based on the previous states. If the last two dice are the same, it must be a gap of at least 3 rolls. If the last two dice are different, it can be any other roll. Finally, it returns the sum of all possible counts.

Please note that this solution might take a long time to run for large input `n` due to its complexity. It has a time complexity of O(n) but it requires a lot of memory to store the 3D array.

This Python code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`. The base case is when `i==j`, which means the length of the substring is 1, and the longest palindromic subsequence is 1 (since it's a single character). For `i<j`, if `s[i]` is equal to `s[j]`, then the longest palindromic subsequence includes `s[i]` and `s[j]`, so the length is `2 + dp[i+1][j-1]`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[j]`, then the longest palindromic subsequence could be either in `s[i+1:j]` or `s[i:j-1]`, so the length is the maximum of `dp[i+1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`. Finally, it returns `dp[0][n-1]` as the result.

"""

# Approach
The sliding window approach is used here. The window is moved from left to right and when the size of the window equals k, we check the minimum number of 'W' required to convert all the 'W' into 'B'. If this number is less than the current minimum, we update the minimum.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we traverse the input string once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the counts of 'W' and 'B'.
"""

# Further explanation
The sliding window approach works well for this problem because it allows us to maintain a window of size k and move it over the string, keeping track of the number of 'W' in the window. We can then calculate the number of operations required to change all 'W' to 'B', and keep track of the minimum. When we slide our window over the string, we remove the leftmost character from our window and add the next character to our window, updating our counts and minimum operations as necessary. This continues until we have travers

This is a greedy algorithm problem. The idea is to sort all workers by the ratio of wage/quality and then use a priority queue to maintain the quality of the K largest workers. For each worker, calculate the total cost by multiplying the wage ratio and the sum of qualities of the K largest workers. Keep track of the smallest total cost.

In this solution, we use Python's heapq module which implements the heap queue algorithm (priority queue), also known as the 'heapq' module. It provides an implementation of the heap queue data structure which allows insertion and extraction of the smallest element in logarithmic time.

The complexity of this solution is O(N log N), where N is the number of workers. This is because we need to sort all workers and add them into a priority queue. The space complexity is O(N) for storing all workers in the priority queue.

The solution should be written inside this class.

This is the solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def solveNQueens(self, n):
        def DFS(queens, xy_diff, xy_sum):
            p = len(queens)

                if q not in queens and p - q not in xy_diff and p + q not in xy_sum: 
                    DFS(queens+[q], xy_diff+[p-q], xy_sum+[p+q])  

        result = []
        DFS([], [], [])
        return [ ["."*i + "Q" + "."*(n-i-1) for i in sol] for sol in result]
```

The above solution uses depth first search (DFS) to find all possible placements of queens. It keeps track of the positions of queens in 'queens', the differences between row and column indices in 'xy_diff', and the sums of row and column indices in 'xy_sum'. For each new queen, it checks whether it can be placed safely by comparing its position with the positions of already placed queens and checking the three conditions: same row, same column, and diagonals. If it can be placed safely, it recursively calls DFS function to place next queen. If all queens are successfully placed, it adds the solution to 'result'. Finally, it returns all solutions in the required format.

This solution uses binary search to find the number of rectangles that can be placed at each height for each point. It creates a list of widths for each height, sorts them, and uses binary search to find the number of rectangles that can be placed at each height for each point. The result is a list of counts for each point.

This code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first initializes a three-dimensional DP table where `dp[i][j][k]` stores the probability that the knight is at position `(i, j)` after `k` moves.

Then it iterates over the remaining steps, updating the probabilities for each position based on the probabilities of its predecessors. The probability for a given step is calculated by summing up the probabilities of the knight's 8 possible moves from the previous step and dividing by 8 (since there are 8 possible moves).

Finally, it returns the probability that the knight is at the desired position after `k` moves.

```
This class uses a dictionary of dictionaries as the underlying data structure. The outer dictionary maps indices to inner dictionaries which map snap_ids to values. We use OrderedDict to keep track of snap_ids in insertion order. When getting a value, we iterate over snap_ids in reverse order to find the largest snap_id not greater than the given snap_id. This is because the snap_ids are in ascending order of when they were taken. If no such snap_id exists, it means the given snap_id is larger than all snap_ids taken so far, so we return the value at the latest snap_id.
Please note that this solution does not meet the constraints of the problem as the set function has a time complexity of O(1). However, since we have used an ordered dictionary, the set operation can be considered as O(logn) where n is the number of snapshots. The get operation also has a time complexity of O(logn).

Explain the code with comments

The problem can be solved using a brute force approach by trying all possible combinations of 4 nodes. However, this will take O(n^4) time which is too slow for large inputs.

To optimize the solution, we first build a graph where each node is connected to its neighbors based on their scores. We then sort the neighbors of each node by their scores in descending order and keep only the top 3. This reduces the number of neighbors we need to consider for each node from O(n) to O(1).

Next, we iterate over all pairs of neighbors (u, v), and for each pair, we iterate over all possible third and fourth neighbors (w, x) such that w and x are not connected to u or v. If they are not, we update our result with the sum of the scores of the four nodes.

This solution works because it tries all possible combinations of 4 nodes and keeps track of the

The function stops once we have found 'n' such numbers. Finally, it returns the sum of all numbers in the result list.

def minWastedSpace(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total = 0
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            total += nums[j - 1]
            for l in range(k):
                dp[i][l + 1] = min(dp[i][l + 1], dp[j - 1][l] + (i - j + 1) * nums[j - 1] - total)

    return min(dp[n])

This python code defines a function `count_divisors_and_sum(n)` to calculate the number of divisors and their sum of a given number `n`. It then uses this function in the main method `sumFourDivisors(nums)` to calculate the sum of divisors of all numbers in `nums` that have exactly four divisors. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^(3/2)), where n is the length of `nums`.

```
This is the solution class which is used to solve the problem. This class has a method called `restoreString` which takes two parameters, a string `s` and a list of integers `indices`. It creates a new list called `result` with the same length as `s` and fills it with empty strings. Then it iterates over the string `s` and the list `indices` simultaneously. For each pair of characters in `s` and `indices`, it sets the corresponding index in `result` to be the character from `s`. Finally, it joins all the strings in `result` into one string and returns it.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating over both the string `s` and the list `indices` once. The space complexity is also O(n) because we are creating a new list `result` with the same length as `s`.

This code works by calculating the number of occurrences of the digit `d` in each number from `low` to `high` using a helper function `countDigits()`. This function iterates through each digit of each number in the range and increments a counter for every occurrence of `d`. The result is then returned by subtracting the count of `d` in numbers less than `low` from the count of `d` in numbers up to `high`.

Here is the explanation:
The main idea is to create a mapping from each blacklist number to a white list number. When we want to pick a number, we first randomly pick a number from the white list (which means all numbers in the range [0, N)), then check whether this number is in the blacklist or not. If it's not, we return this number; otherwise, we return the corresponding white list number.

This approach has two parts:
1. Initialize the white list numbers. We start from N and move forward until we find a number which is not in the blacklist. This is done by checking whether the current index is in the blacklist or not.
2. Construct the mapping from blacklist numbers to white list numbers.

In terms of time complexity, the initialization takes O(B), where B is the size of the blacklist. And for each pick operation, it takes O(1) time. So the total time complexity is O(B + P), where P is the number of pick operations.

Here is the solution:

        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:

        for s in size:
            total -= s
            res += s * total

        return res
```

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to find the size of each connected component in the graph. Then it calculates the number of pairs of unreachable nodes using the formula `res += s * (total - s)`, where `s` is the size of a connected component and `total` is the total number of nodes. The result is the sum of these pair counts for all connected components.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input graph is connected. If it can have multiple disconnected components, then additional code would be needed to handle those cases.

It compares the current element and the next one, and if they satisfy the conditions of being turbulent, it updates the end of the subarray. If not, it moves the start of the subarray to the current position and continues. The maximum length of the turbulent subarray is kept track of by the variable `res`.

The heapq module is used to implement the priority queue required by Prim's algorithm.

The time complexity of this solution is O(E log E), where E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is O(E), where E is the number of edges in the graph.

The above Python code uses a sliding window approach where it slides through the string `s`. For each character in the string, it calculates the cost of changing the current character of `s` to the corresponding character of `t`. If this cost exceeds `maxCost`, the left pointer of the window moves one step to the right and the cost is reduced accordingly. The size of the window (i.e., the length of the substring) is updated every time the cost of the window is updated. The maximum length of the window is returned as the result.

Explain the code in detail:

- We start by initializing three variables: `left`, `max_length`, and `total_cost`. `left` is the starting index of the current window, `max_length` is the maximum length of the valid substring we have seen so far, and `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of changing the characters in the current window.

- Then we iterate over the string `s`. For each character, we calculate the cost of changing it to the corresponding character in `t` using `abs(ord(s[right]) - ord(t[right]))`. This cost is added to `total_cost`.

- If `total_cost` exceeds `maxCost`, we move the left pointer of the window one step to

# Explanation
The solution uses a double-ended queue (deque) from the collections library in Python. The deque is used because it allows us to add elements to both ends in O(1) time complexity.

In the `__init__` method, we initialize an empty deque.

In the `ping` method, we first add the current time `t` to the end of the deque. Then, we keep popping elements from the front of the deque as long as they are less than `t - 3000`. This is because these elements are outside the last 3000 milliseconds window and can be discarded. Finally, we return the size of the deque, which represents the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds.

I am looking for a python solution code for this problem.
I tried to solve this problem using dynamic programming but I couldn't get the correct answer. I think there might be some misunderstanding about how to use the concept of dynamic programming here. Please help me to understand the concept and give me a python solution.

In this problem, we are given a matrix representing a classroom where '.' represents an empty seat and '#' represents a broken seat. The students can sit in empty seats only. A student can see the answer of the student sitting in front or behind him but cannot see the answer of the student sitting next to him. We have to return the maximum number of students that can sit together without any cheating being possible.

Your task is to implement the `minTime` function inside this class.

        hens.sort()

This solution works by sorting both lists of hens and grains. Then it calculates the maximum difference between corresponding elements in the sorted hens list and grains list. This is because the hen that needs to travel the maximum distance to the closest grain will need the most time.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operations, where n is the length of the input lists. The space complexity is O(n) as we need to store the sorted lists.

Here is the solution code:

```python
class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums):
        total = 0
        msv = 1
        for num in nums:
            total += num
            if total < 1:
                msv += abs(total) + 1
                total += abs(total) + 1
        return msv

Test cases:

```python
print(Solution().minStartValue([-3,2,-3,4,2])) # Output: 5
print(Solution().minStartValue([1,2])) # Output: 1
print(Solution().minStartValue([1,-2,-3])) # Output: 5
```

This solution works by iterating over the input list of numbers and maintaining a running total. If at any point the running total is less than 1, we add the absolute value of the running total plus one to our minimum start value (_msv_) and also add this same amount to our running total. This ensures that our running total will always be at least 1 at the end of the loop. The final value of _msv_ is then returned as the minimum start value.

Explaination:In this problem, we need to implement a class named Solution which has two methods: \__init\_\_(self, nums) and pick(self, target). The method \__init\_\_(self, nums) initializes the object with the input list 'nums'. We create a dictionary called 'indices' where for every unique number in 'nums', we store the list of its indices. The method pick(self, target) returns a random index 'i' from 'nums' such that 'nums[i]' equals to 'target'. The returned index should have an equal probability of being chosen. This can be achieved by using Python's built-in random.choice() function which selects a random element from the input list.

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the maximum length of the palindrome. It creates a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum length of the palindrome that can be formed using `word1[i:]` and `word2[j:]`. For each character in `word1` and `word2`, it checks if they are equal. If they are, it updates `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i+1][j-1] + 2` (since we found a matching pair). If they are not, it takes the maximum length of the palindrome that can be formed by skipping the current character in either `word1` or `word2`. Finally, it returns the maximum length of the palindrome that can be formed.

Your task is to implement the `matrixScore` function inside this class.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def matrixScore(self, grid):
        R, C = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        # ensure the most significant bit is 1
        # by flipping the rows if necessary
        for r in range(R):
            if grid[r][0] == 0:
                for c in range(C):
                    grid[r][c] ^= 1

        # for each column from the second column
        # if there are more zeros than ones
        # flip the column to make more ones
        # keep track of the score
        score = R * (1 << (C - 1))
        for c in range(1, C):
            col = sum(grid[r][c] == grid[0][c] for r in range(R))
            score += max(col, R - col) * (1 << (C - c - 1))

        return score
```

This solution works by first ensuring the most significant bit is always 1. This is done by flipping all rows where the first bit is 0. Then, it iterates over each column from the second column onwards. If there are more 0's than 1's in that column, it flips the column so that there are more 1's. The score is then calculated by summing up the values of the binary numbers represented by the rows.

The solution works by recursively dividing the space into quadrants and counting the ships in each quadrant. The base case is when the top right and bottom left points are the same, which means that there is only one ship at that point. If the `hasShips` function returns false for the current quadrant, we return 0. Otherwise, we divide the quadrant into four smaller quadrants and recursively count the ships in each of them.

```
This solution works by sorting the balloons by their end positions and then iterating over them. If a balloon starts after the end of the previous balloon, it means an additional arrow is needed to burst it. Therefore, we increment the count of arrows. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation and the space complexity is O(1) since no additional space is used.

    if not points:

```

This solution works by generating all possible permutations of the input array, then checking each one to see if it represents a valid 24-hour time. A valid time is one where the hours are less than 24 and the minutes are less than 60. The maximum valid time is then returned. If there are no valid times, an empty string is returned.

The function should return a TreeNode which is the root of the modified BST.

Python Code:

```python
class TreeNode(object):
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def insertIntoBST(self, root, val):
        if root is None:
            return TreeNode(val)
        
        if val < root.val:
            root.left = self.insertIntoBST(root.left, val)

            root.right = self.insertIntoBST(root.right, val)
            
        return root
```

This Python code uses recursive approach to solve the problem. If the current node is None, it means we have found the position where we can insert the new node, so we create a new node with the given value and return it. If the value of the new node is less than the value of the current node, we move to the left subtree, otherwise we move to the right subtree. We keep doing this until we find an appropriate position to insert the new node. Finally, we return the root of the tree.

    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
