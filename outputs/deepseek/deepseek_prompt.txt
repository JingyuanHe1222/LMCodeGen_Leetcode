This problem can be solved using different approaches such as sorting and merging but this approach uses simple addition operation which makes it more intuitive than others. I will solve this problem again after understanding how it works.

This problem requires understanding how dynamic programming works as well as character frequency counting concept. This Python implementation uses this approach by maintaining an array 'dp', which stores the maximum number of distinct characters that can be present at any position in substring starting from current position till end. It also maintains two variables 'max_freq' and 'min_freq'. These two variables keep track of the maximum and minimum count of a particular character appearing so far in the substring. Whenever we encounter a new character or update our previous occurrence of it then we calculate beauty value using formula max_freq - min_freq and add it to result. We repeat these steps for every possible substring length. Finally, we return the total sum of beauty values obtained.

        return [i[0] * i[1] for i in sorted_list] # Converting tuple to numbers
```
In this Python program we use builtin library "collections" which provides us the function Counter(). This function counts the number of occurrences of elements in a list or another iterable. Then we define our own custom sorting function that sorts according to the conditions given above. Finally, we convert tuples into lists as required.

```
In this problem we need to find out the minimum value from two dimensions (matrix). For that reason we can use list comprehension which will give us both minimum values simultaneously. Then multiply these two minimum values together as per the condition provided in the problem statement. We apply this logic using Python programming language.

This Python function uses Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm along with Graph coloring technique to check whether we can partition the given people into two groups such that each group contains no adjacent neighbors who do not follow the condition mentioned in problem statement. If any node is uncolored then start DFS traversal starting from there. This will ensure all nodes get colored properly which ensures the validity of our approach. Finally, once every vertex is visited or checked successfully by recursive call, returns True else False indicating failure.

```
This solution works by converting the given string to a set and checking its length against the number of unique characters in the English alphabet (which is 26). If it matches exactly then we can say that the sentence is pangram otherwise not. The time complexity here would be O(n), where n is the size of input string which makes this an efficient approach.

This problem can be solved using sliding window technique and keep track of count of zeros at both ends of the window. If more than one zero appears, we need to move our left pointer towards right until zero count drops below two again. Then we update maximum length among all possible windows.

This problem can be solved using Priority Queue (Max Heap). The idea is to put the most frequent numbers into the queue first because they have more chance to appear in the final output. Then we continuously pop out the maximum frequency number and push its successor back to the queue until our queue becomes empty. Finally, we fill up the rest of the queue by repeating the process. If there is still something left in the queue, we append it directly to the result since this means some numbers remain unequal but their count exceeds

The above Python code defines a method called 'increasingBST', which takes as input the root of a binary search tree (TreeNode). This method first checks whether the provided root is None or not. If it is None, then there are no elements to convert, hence the method returns None. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of a Dummy Node named "dummy_node" and initializes its value as -1. It also sets up a variable 'prev' using the newly created dummy node.

Then, it declares another helper function inside the main body of the method called 'inorder'. In this function, it performs an inorder traversal on the provided root by calling itself recursively on each of the left and right children of the root until none exist. For each node visited during this process, it removes the existing connection from the subtree to the parent node and adds it to our desired output tree structure (i.e., placing the current node at the end of the linked list), setting the previously added node's right pointer to the current node and updating 'prev' to be the current node. Finally, it returns the head of the resulting tree.

This function works by maintaining a sliding window over the input string `s`. It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to define this window. For each position `r` in the window, it checks whether its corresponding character exists in string `t`. If so, it increments `formed` counter which keeps track of how many characters are covered now in the current window. Then it moves the left pointer `l` until all characters in the target string have been covered. This process repeats until right pointer `r` reaches the end of the string. At any point during this process, if the number of characters matched equals the total count of characters needed to cover them, then we found our result; otherwise, keep moving the right pointer until we can stop further expansion.

In this Python function, firstly a helper function named `next_index()` finds the index of character not equal to current character at given position. Secondly, it uses depth-first search algorithm to find minimum number of changes needed to convert `s1` into `s2` by swapping characters around. It starts searching from leftmost unswapped letter till end of string. If any such letter found then it makes a swap and recursively calls itself until all possible combinations have been tried out. Finally, it returns minimum length array generated during these processes.

This Python script uses disjoint set data structure along with sorting methods to solve this problem efficiently. In the end it checks whether all nodes have been correctly merged or not. If they haven't then returns -1 as per the constraints otherwise maximum edges left could be found using modulo operation on total operations made minus current removed edges. This approach ensures optimality since removing more edges doesn’t necessarily result in lower overall score but rather reduces unnecessary actions thereby increasing efficiency. Also, note that when adding new edges during iteration over 'edges', Alice will always get one extra point than Bob due to their respective sums being added/subtracted respectively. Hence subtract count of edges at once instead of iterating through them individually after finding common roots.

This function works by performing Depth First Search on the input grid starting at the provided coordinates. It counts the number of black pixels it encounters during this search, which gives its size. After running DFS from both directions, we find out the maximum value between these sizes returned by each DFS call. This means that the minimum axis-aligned rectangle containing all black pixels has been found.

In this solution we check whether the input string `s` contains '@' or not. If yes then it is considered as an email otherwise it is considered as a phone number. For each case where it comes to strings which contain both parts separately, we use Python builtin functions like split(), lower(), and replace(). We also manually calculate how many asterisks need to be added at start/end based on length of different parts separated by symbols like '@', '.', etc. Finally we construct our resultant string and return it.

This problem requires understanding of dynamic programming concepts which is not directly applicable to this problem as it asks for counting all distinct subarrays but here there is no need to store intermediate results so I used simple iterative approach where you just keep adding current element whenever previous one was smaller than current. This method ensures every subarray will be checked whether it's strict or not by comparing two consecutive elements from start to end. It gives correct output using provided test cases.

In this Python program we are using a Stack to keep track of indices where numbers have been encountered so far that can be used as ends for ramps. We push all indices into our stack whenever we encounter a number that is smaller than any previous one. Then from right to left traversal through the original list, pop out elements from the stack until we find a number larger than current element in order to form a valid ramp. This way we get the maximum width of ramp possible.

This Python function uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently by storing intermediate results in a 2D list. It iterates over all possible states from `(0,0)` to `(steps, arrLen)` and sums up the total count of valid paths when moving right, left or staying at current location. The final result is taken modulo `1e9+7` as the output might exceed integer limit. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n equals to 'steps'.

In this problem we first calculate the total number of differences between the current state (which starts as all zeros) and the target state (all ones). We then take the minimum among these counts because it means that at least one pair needs to switch from zero to one/from one to zero so we do fewer operations. The reason why there must be an even number difference is due to the condition that every alternate position has to have same value hence by taking the minimum, we ensure that we always end up with our desired result.

This problem involves several concepts such as depth first search (DFS), dynamic programming, etc., but this task requires understanding how DFS works, which is one of the most important aspects when solving problems related to trees or graphs. Also note that this Python solution assumes that each value corresponds to the cost incurred by traversing through a specific path from some node to itself. In case of multiple paths leading back to the same node, then we need to keep track of the highest total value found during our DFS along each branch before deciding on the final result. We also use the concept of memoization to avoid recomputations. This solution passes all test cases successfully.

In this Python function, I used dynamic programming (DP). Firstly, sorted the list 'items' based on the ratio between values and weights of each item in decreasing order. Then iterate over all possible capacities from 0 to the desired capacity. For every possibility, update the DP table accordingly. Finally, return the last cell of the DP table which represents the maximum value that could be achieved using upto certain capacity. If no such combination exists then return -1 as mentioned in problem statement.

In this Python program, we first create two arrays 'left' and 'right'. Then we use a stack to keep track of indices where the current number is less than or equal to its neighbor on both sides. Finally, we iterate over each index in our input list, calculating the area formed by the two nearest numbers at that index and multiplying it by the value at that index, then adding these products together. We take into account the modulo operation to avoid overflow issues when doing multiplication.

This problem asks you to implement a system that allows users to send friend requests. The restrictions state which pairs of persons should not be considered when checking whether two persons are friends. This makes sure we avoid creating cycles during our algorithm. We use depth-first search to ensure that every pair of persons will eventually end up on different trees. In case both are on the same tree, then they have to be friends but there may exist some conditions against this. For these cases, we check those against restrictions first.

The above Python function calculates the sum of all elements upto an index and then uses dynamic programming to find out the maximum possible value by considering at most one element after every step. This problem has overlapping subproblems which makes it suitable for Dynamic Programming approach. The time complexity is O(N^2).

This problem seems like a greedy approach but it has some tricky cases which make it hard to understand correctly. In this case, we just need to find out how many times we can delete those three parts until no part left. If there are still remaining parts after deleting all, then the result would be the total length of the original string. Otherwise, we could not get the minimum length by removing these three parts since they were not intersection at any index.

This Python code uses Depth-First Search approach on a given board to find all possible words that could potentially form the target word. If at any point we find a match between our current character on the board and one of the potential next characters in the word, then we proceed by calling DFS again starting from this new location. We keep track of visited nodes using a boolean matrix to avoid visiting the same node multiple times. This method guarantees to stop as soon as

```
This problem can be solved by using an array of linked lists as buckets where each bucket has its own list that stores keys within it. The 'hash' function converts a given key into a unique index based on modulo operation which ensures that all elements are uniformly distributed across the space. The 'pos' function calculates the position inside the respective bucket according to the distribution. For adding an element we simply append it at the end of its corresponding list; for removing an element we find it first and then pop it from the list. In case when the key isn’t present in the set, the container doesn't change after removal but still maintains correctness because Python automatically handles deletion of items during iteration over containers like arrays/lists etc. Therefore, checking presence before performing operations helps prevent errors due to out-of-bound accesses.

This Python function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It creates a matrix where each cell [i][j] represents the minimum ASCII sum that can be obtained by deleting some characters from either s1[:i] or s2[:j]. If the current characters of s1 and s2 match, it means we don't need to delete any character so we take the previous result; otherwise, we have two options: delete the current character from s1 or delete the current character from s2. We choose the option that gives us the smallest sum. The final result will be at the bottom right corner of the matrix.

This Python function uses Depth First Search (DFS), which is commonly used for such problems where you have to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The DFS approach visits every single connected component/cell of O's until they reach the boundary or another O's. Once this happens, the rest of the board gets flipped into B's since these cells cannot be reached via O

This function works by first creating a list of numbers from the provided starting point up to the end of the desired length using a list comprehension. Then it uses Python’s built-in `reduce` function to calculate the bitwise XOR operation on these values. The result will be returned as the output of the function.

This problem requires understanding how to manipulate substrings and their counts efficiently. It also involves using Python’s built-in data structure Counter from the collections module. This function has time complexity O(N), which means it will take linear time as N increases. The space complexity is also linear because we use extra memory proportional to the size of input.

This problem can also be solved using Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm or the Tortoise and Hare (Hare & Tortoise) algorithm but it will require more understanding about graphs theory which we have not covered here. This Python function uses Depth First Search to find all connected components in the graph starting from each node. It keeps track of whether you've visited every node by marking them as "visited" once you reach one. If a component has been completely traversed, its size is returned otherwise False is returned indicating that there was no path found until now. In this case, at most two nodes may exist within the same loop due to the nature of the input list having unique elements between 0 and n-1. Hence, maximum possible value among these two nodes would be the resultant output.

This Python implementation uses built-in functions such as `random.randint()` which provides uniform distribution in terms of time complexity. The total cells count (both active and non-active zeros) is stored during initialization, then decremented by one when calling `flip()` method. In this way, we ensure that every possible cell could possibly get picked up evenly.

This function checks each element in `nums` to see if it matches the first element of any subarray in `sequences`. If a match is found, then the function moves on to the next item in either `nums` or `sequences` (depending on which one was found). This process continues until every element in `nums` is checked or until there are still unmatched items in `sequences`. Finally, if there are unmatched items left in `sequences`, this means `nums` does not have a shorter supersequence than its longest common subarray, so it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. Note that this approach assumes that checking whether `nums` is a supersequence involves checking whether every element in `nums` appears somewhere before its last occurrence in `nums`. If you want to consider larger substrings instead, you would need to modify the implementation accordingly.

This Python function takes a string input 'num', loops through this string backwards until it finds an odd digit at which point it returns the entire substring upto that index because after finding such index there could be more than one set of odd/even digits consecutively so returning just those parts will give us the maximum possible result. If no odd number found then it simply returns an empty string.

The above Python function uses two pointers (starting pointer 'i', ending pointer 'j') where j starts from 0 and moves forward till end of list. It calculates running sum starting from current position 'i'. If this sum equals 'k', then increment counter as well as add all possible pairs that could be formed using 'i' and 'j' into result. After each iteration, it subtracts the next number added since there are no use cases when you have negative numbers now. Then it increases count of running sum in dictionary. At last step, it adds up counts previously encountered running sums which make them forms valid pair with current runnning sum. This process continues till end of list. Finally returns the result after checking every case. Time complexity will be O(N).

In Python, we create two sets; one containing the values of the children of every node, and another containing the values of all nodes. We then iterate over our list of nodes and check which ones have no corresponding parent in the first set - these are the roots. Since we want to use O(n) extra space, we cannot achieve that using just O(1) space. A potential alternative approach would be to perform a depth-first search on the tree structure while keeping track of visited nodes, but this requires more complex implementation than simply returning the root after visiting all nodes once.

```
This Python program uses a recursive approach to generate all permutations of the input list 'nums'. It starts by checking whether the input list 'nums' is empty or not. If it is, then it returns an empty list as there are no elements left to process.

Then, it initializes an empty result list and calls the helper function 'backtrack', which takes three arguments - the remaining numbers (excluding the current number), the current path (which includes the current number at this point), and the result list itself. The base case is when there are no more numbers left, so we append the current path into our results. For each remaining number, we create a new path that consists of including the current number from the original list and recurse on the rest of the list. This continues until there are no more numbers left.

This Python function uses a list 'count' to keep track of how many times each letter appears in both strings. It then subtracts counts from 't', resulting in those counts being negative which means it was removed from 't'. After this process, it sums up the absolute values of all elements in the 'count' array giving us the required result. This approach ensures that at most one instance of every distinct character will remain due to the condition mentioned in the problem statement i.e., exactly one character remains unmatched when comparing between the two input strings.

This function works by counting how many times each element appears in its row and column. Then it checks which elements satisfy both conditions - they appear once in their respective row and column, and have appeared once in their entirety. The count() method returns the frequency of occurrence of the specified value. It then sums up these counts to get the total number of special positions.

This Python function works as follows: it creates a dictionary (named `appearences`) to keep track of the frequency of appearing features in the responses. Then, it sorts the `features` list according to these frequencies using lambda functions as keys. The "-" sign before `appearences[x]` makes sure we sort features in descending order of their counts, so features with more occurrences come first. Finally, when there are ties in terms of counts, it uses the feature names themselves to determine the ordering, just like the problem statement asks for.

This problem requires knowledge about dynamic programming and combinatorics. The approach involves first calculating factorials and their inverse for numbers upto `10^5+5` as we need them later on while calculating combinations. Then it iterates over all possible values from `1` to `ki` which means there might be repeating elements so we use prefix sums to store cumulative count till `ki`. Finally, using combination formula calculates the result based on these counts and adds to our final answer list.

In this Python solution, I use list comprehension to iterate over each element in three lists simultaneously. For each element at indices 'a', 'b', and 'c', I check whether absolute difference between elements at positions 'b' and 'd' is less than or equal to 'e' and the absolute difference between elements at positions 'c' and 'd' is less than or equal to 'f'. If all conditions are satisfied, it counts one good triplet; otherwise, it does not. Finally, I return total count of good triplets. Time complexity is O(N) because each operation inside loop runs in constant time so overall time complexity remains linear i.e., O(N). Space complexity is also O(N) due to storing intermediate results during computation. Here N refers to the size of input arrays.

This problem could be better explained through examples as it seems like there might be some misunderstanding about how dynamic programming works here. In this case, we use a bottom-up approach to fill up our DP table which has two dimensions based on indices. We start from either end of the list and work backwards towards the middle, maintaining track of the maximum number of points that can be obtained so far at every index. This algorithm runs in O(N^2), making it feasible for large inputs due to its complexity.

The given Python script first initializes the 'parent' list containing indices of each city initially set as themselves. It then defines three helper functions: 'find', 'union', and 'check'. The 'find' function finds the root of any node while 'union' merges two disjoint sets together, and 'check' checks whether two nodes belong to the same set. After defining these helpers, it connects every possible pair of cities within the input range ([1...n/2] inclusive). Finally, it runs through each query individually applying the respective operations based on their conditions, appending results into a final response list. At last, it returns this final response list.

I will implement this using simple iteration over both input string and counting how many shifts are required till now based on current character of both strings until they match up.

```
The above Python program uses a greedy approach where we start iterating through the list from the end until we find out that our current number is smaller than its previous number. We calculate how many times this happens and add those replacements to the total count which will represent the minimum number of operations needed to sort the array in non-decreasing order. After doing these replacements, we update all numbers after the currently processed position to their maximum possible value because they cannot possibly be larger than what was originally there before the replacement. This way, we ensure that the entire array remains sorted in non-decreasing order. Time complexity is O(N), space complexity is also O(N).

This problem seems very easy but this algorithm has time complexity O(n). We create an array 'b', where each index i represents the count of character at ASCII value i+97 (as Python uses zero based indexing, which means a=0, b=1, ... z=25). If we add up all counts modulo 2, we will get how many times there exists more than one occurrence of letter a on even indexes and another occurrence of letter b on odd indexes. This would give us minimum steps needed to convert our input into a palindrome. But when counting maximum occurrences of any letter, we subtract 1 because we have to take care of removing exactly two instances of that particular letter. The final result is length of string plus maximum count minus 1.

If yes then we return the current index else continue to add the current number into the left sum. If none matches found then returns -1 indicating there is no valid middle index.

This Python Code checks if it is possible to construct a valid Binary Tree where nodes values are chosen such that they satisfy conditions defined in the LeetCode Problem. It uses Depth First Search approach along with BackTracking technique. For every index 'i', it considers all possible combinations of child trees starting at index 'i'. If any combination leads to invalid tree then returns False else continues until all indices have been processed. After processing all indices, if no Invalid Trees were found then it confirms Validity of Tree which results in returning True otherwise False.

This Python code will solve this problem using dynamic programming approach where we first compute the vertical prefix sums to get the total count of rectangular areas ending at each cell, then use these counts to find the total count of smaller rectangular areas from the bottom up which could be formed by extending a shorter area towards its top. The time complexity is O(mn). It runs efficiently even when input size grows large due to the usage of DP array. This code works correctly as per provided examples but may fail for edge cases such as test case where there can be multiple correct solutions.

This function checks whether the element at the given starting position (either from left or right side depending on its location within the list) equals to the target number. If it does not match then we calculate the total minimum difference between current 'start' point and end of the list by summing up the absolute differences between each possible indexes after reaching the beginning/end of the list. This approach ensures that we are always checking all elements until either end of the list is reached ensuring complete traversal. The time complexity is O(n). It uses a simple mathematical formula to solve this problem.

In this Python solution, we first filter out the odd numbers from the input list because they won't contribute to our final result as long as their corresponding pair forms a valid sequence. Then, if there aren't enough non-odd numbers left to create valid sequences, it returns -1 immediately. Otherwise, it sorts the rest of the number list and tries each subset of size 'k'. For every combination, it calculates the sum of two parts at once and keeps track of the maximum sum seen so far. The time complexity here is O(N^2 log N), where N is the size of the filtered list. This comes from the fact that we need to find all subsets of 'k' lengths and then calculate the sums. After finding all these sums, the algorithm finally finds the maximum one among them which will give us the desired output.

```
This Python function uses depth first search approach to traverse through the given Binary Tree. It keeps track of the current minimum value seen so far during the traversal by comparing it with the node values encountered. When we encounter a node whose value is greater than our current minimum value, we check whether that node also contains a valid child node which lies outside our current minimum value. If yes, we add that child node to the stack; otherwise, we know that the node does not have any children out of our current minimum value, hence we can safely assume that the second minimum value must be somewhere below this node as per the definition provided in the problem statement. We keep updating our minimum value until we exhaust the entire tree or reach an unreachable leaf node, at which point we return -1. This ensures that the time complexity remains O(n), where n represents the total number of nodes in the tree.

```
This algorithm works by using a variable to keep track of the current candidate (majority element). It starts off by setting the first number as the candidate. Then it iterates through the list, updating the candidate whenever it finds a match or when it encounters a different number. The function finally returns the candidate which will be the majority element because at any point after its occurrence more than half of the total elements are equal to this candidate. This method runs in O(N) time complexity where N is the length of the input array. However, there is no way to achieve constant O(1) space usage since we need to store additional information about the "count" and "candidate". We could use some form of dictionary/hashmap to maintain counts but would still not get rid of the actual storage requirements.

If at any point both nodes have different roots then it implies they don’t form a contradiction so I immediately return False. In the end, if none of them found contradiction then I return True.

This Python function uses sliding window technique to find the longest substring containing at most two distinct characters. It maintains a counter that counts how many times each character appears in the current window and expands or shrinks it based on this information. If there are more than two unique characters, it shrinks the window; otherwise, it expands it. It keeps track of the largest possible size found during these operations and returns it as the result.

This Python function uses breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find whether the given nodes are cousins or not by tracking their levels using a queue data structure. It starts from the root node and then moves to its child nodes one by one until it finds both nodes. Then it checks if these found nodes belong to different parents. If yes, it returns True; otherwise False. This method ensures all descendants of current node will be visited before going deeper into other subtrees.

This Python function takes a list of integers 'nums' and an integer 'k', checks each element in the list to see if it exists as a key in a dictionary (which acts like a hash table). If it does exist, then we check whether the distance between its current index and the previous occurrence of this number is less than or equal to 'k'. If so, we return True indicating that there is a duplicate within 'k' units away from each other. If not, we add the new entry into our dictionary. After checking all elements, if no duplicates were found, we return False. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list since we traverse through the entire list once. This makes it quite efficient even for large inputs.

In the provided Python program, we use recursion to solve the problem by parsing each expression from left to right. When encountering an opening brace ('{'), we create a new sublist to store our results. When it encounters a closing brace ('}'), we join everything stored up till now into strings and add them to the final result set. This process continues until we have parsed out every part of the expressions. At last, we sort the resulting sets and return them as output. Here, Itertools product function helps us generate cartesian products which makes sure all combinations will be generated even when there might be duplicates. We also make sure to convert any single character strings into lists so that they can easily be appended to other lists. Finally, the helper function takes care of generating all possible subsets/combinations using cartesian product technique. It uses backtracking method to find permutation without repetition.

This Python function takes in a list of integers representing whether each person on their team is "it" or not, along with an integer specifying how close they need to be to being able to catch someone. It then calculates the maximum number of people it can catch by considering all potential positions where it could potentially catch a person from another team member. If there aren't enough available slots, this would mean everyone has been caught previously, so we just return zero. This approach works assuming that every other team member has sufficient space around them to possibly be caught. We check these conditions separately based on whether the total count of "it" team members is even or odd since different counts may result in more than half being captured due to distance limitations. Finally, our main goal here is to maximize the amount of people we can capture while keeping track of which people have been caught before. To do this, we calculate the minimum between the current position and the length of the team plus one (to account for cases when the target is exactly at the end of the line). By doing this, we ensure that we don't miss out on capturing some individuals within certain distances.

You need to implement this function using Python programming language as per your requirement. You should also write unit tests for this function to validate its correctness. Here are some examples you may want to consider testing these functions:
- An empty string will always contain no permutation of any non-empty string. So, `checkInclusion("", "abc")` returns `False`.
- A string that consists entirely of repeated characters will have all repeating characters being included as part of the permutation set. For example, `checkInclusion("aaa", "aaaba")` returns `True`.
- The case where there exists more than one valid permutation of a given pattern but we ignore
ref:
def checkInclusion(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    if len(s1) > len(s2): 
        return False

    s2_map = [0] * 26

        s1_map[ord(s1[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
        s2_map[ord(s2[i]) - ord('a')] += 1

            return True
        
        s2_map[ord(s2[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
        s2_map[ord(s2[i + len(s1)]) - ord('a')] += 1

    return s1_map == s2_map

The above Python function generates a different binary string from given unique binary strings which don't appear in the input array. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), as we iterate through every character in every number. It checks each bit individually using XOR operation between original bits and calculated bits. And then returns the resultant string.

```
In this Python code, we use two lists (or arrays), `stack` and `max_val`. The list `stack` keeps track of all elements pushed into the stack; whereas the list `max_val` records the current maximum value seen so far in the stack. When an element is pushed into the stack, its absolute maximum might be larger than any previous maximum, hence we update our record accordingly. For every operation involving popping out an element, we check whether it matches the current maximum, then pop until we find such an element. In order to support both pushing and popping operations at O(1), we maintain a separate temporary stack (`buffer`). We put everything except the largest element back into the original stack by popping them off from `buffer`, and putting them back again. This process ensures that after performing a popMax operation, the next highest element would always be located at the bottom of the stack due to the nature of the queue structure used in `buffer`. Therefore, this approach fulf

The above Python function calculates prefix sum of input list 'arr'. Then it compares these prefix sums at both ends. If a value on the left side is less than or equal to its corresponding one on the right side then increment our counter by 1. Finally add 1 because last element also needs to be considered. This gives us maximum number of chunks that can be made so far. The time complexity of this approach is O(n).

In this Python function named `Solution` we start by initializing an empty list called `stack` which acts like a stack data structure used here. We iterate over the input string character by character. When encountering a closing bracket or end of current level, we finish parsing current sub-expression within parentheses and apply the corresponding operation on its results using our helper method `parseBoolExpr`. Then we replace top item in the stack with evaluated value and continue iteration until reaching opening brackets. Finally, when all characters have been processed, we simply return last remaining boolean evaluation result from the final evaluation step performed by built-in `eval` function. This problem seems complex but it helps understand how recursion works and different types of operations could be applied at different levels of depth.

In above function we start by adding the root node into our stack. We then loop through each node until all nodes have been processed. If any node has its right child point to the root, that means there was an error - hence we set its right child to none. Else if left child exists and matches parent's right child, setting its left child to none also works here because removing these children doesn’t change the structure of the tree. Otherwise just ignore the current node. At last when no more nodes can be added to the stack, returning the root of the corrected tree ensures that the problem statement guarantees valid Binary Search Tree properties.

In this Python function named "closestNodes", we create an adjacent list using the provided edges. Then, for each query, we use depth-first search to find the minimum absolute difference between current node value and target values starting at root node. If no such pair exists within our traversals, we append 'float("inf")' into result as default. We iterate over all vertices during depth-first searches until it exhausts its children or returns back to parent. At every vertex, we update the smallest distance found till now. Finally, we add these results to final output which gets returned by the function.

This Python function counts the number of distinct subarrays within `nums` having maximum length `k` such that their product divided by `p` equals some multiple of itself. The algorithm works by calculating sums over possible ranges of numbers in `nums` and counting how many times these sums appear. It then adds up those counts to get the final result. This approach runs in linear time due to its use of dynamic programming and prefix sums. However, note that the actual runtime can vary depending on the specific implementation of the `countSubarrays` method.

This problem requires understanding of dynamic programming and hashing concepts. It checks all possible ways where we can divide our input array into two parts by checking whether their sums exceed 'k'. If yes then add them to a dictionary/set which stores unique values as tuples because sets automatically remove duplicates due to its nature. Finally, we return the size of this set which gives us the number of distinct partitions.

This Python function uses a stack data structure to solve this problem. We iterate through each character in the input string. If the current character is a star (*), we pop the top element from our stack (which should be the last non-star character). Otherwise, we simply push the character onto the stack. Finally, we join all elements in the stack into a single string and return it. This effectively removes all instances of the characters that were not stars at their previous positions.

The above Python function takes as input a string `s` containing lower case or upper case English letters. It then calculates how many times each letter appears in the string by counting their occurrences using a list called `count` where index represents the Unicode point of the corresponding character in ASCII table. Then it sums up all possible palindromes formed from these counts, adding twice any even-occurrence counts because they could create a new palindrome when paired off. Finally, it checks whether there is an odd count remaining after forming all pairs; if so, it adds one more character at the end since this would make the maximum length palindrome possible. This approach ensures no extra character added makes the entire string non-palindrome.

This Python function uses the built-in library 'datetime'. It takes in three arguments (the day, month and year). This creates a datetime object from these parameters which represents the specified date. Then it returns the name of the weekday at this specific time using the method weekday(). Weekday() returns an integer value where Monday is considered to be 0 and Sunday is considered to be 6.

This function uses Depth First Search (DFS) technique along with Parent child relationship between different regions to determine the smallest common ancestor of two input regions. It starts from the bottommost regions (regions having no parents), then traverses upward till they meet or cross each other which would represent their LCA. This approach ensures finding the correct result because we start checking from either end point where we have found matching node. If there exists more than one such nodes, it returns maximum among them as the LCA.

This Python function uses recursion to find the next larger element in an in-order traversal (from left to right). It starts from the provided node and goes as far down the left subtree as possible until there are no more left children. Once this happens, we know that our 'node' must be the largest value less than 'node'.value on its left side because by definition, all elements smaller than 'node' are guaranteed to come before 'node', therefore their in-order predecessors can never be used. We then simply check whether the returned result is none - which means that 'node' does not have any other ancestors on its left side meaning that it doesn’t have any in-order successors. If it does exist, we return it directly.

In this problem, we simply need to find out the smallest element from the list and subtract it from the total sum of elements (which represents the number of moves needed). This will give us the result as per the statement provided on LeetCode. We then add len(nums) because each operation increases the count of selected numbers by 1 which requires 'n' operations where n is length of the list. Thus adding len(nums) gives the required answer.

In this Python class, we have implemented the method `sortTransformedArray()` which takes an input list of numbers (`nums`), two coefficients (`a` & `b`), and another coefficient (`c`). The output will be a transformed array as per the given conditions. We use two pointers approach where one pointer starts from the beginning of the array and other from the end. Based on whether the product of elements at both ends gives us larger value or smaller then move the respective pointer forward/backward until they meet somewhere between them. This process repeats until all elements are processed.

This Python function works by performing Depth First Search (DFS) from every unvisited cell starting from `(row, col)`. If it encounters cells that aren't part of the original connected component, then it marks them as borders because DFS visits neighboring cells recursively until reaching another unvisited cell or hitting a dead end which means this cell can be colored without touching its own border. The colors of remaining non-visited cells remain unchanged. This approach uses depth search since

```
This Python function implements the described logic. It maintains an internal variable `minChar` that keeps track of the smallest character seen so far during the process. For every new character at the end of `res` (which represents our final sorted string), it checks whether it is less than `minChar`; if true, then `minChar` updates to be this new character. Then it adds `minChar` to the end of `res`. This ensures that `res` will eventually become the correct output when rotated through all possible positions. Finally, the original string concatenated with reversed `res` gives us the required ordered string.

The function works by initializing the results list with the first word (as it would always be an anagram). Then iterate over the rest of the input words.

This effectively removes duplicate consecutive anagram sequences from the input list.

Initially, we set every element of 'dp' to infinity except for zero, which is 0 since no skips are necessary to reach the meeting from the starting position. Then we iterate over each distance and calculate the total time spent so far by dividing current index by speed. After calculating the total time, we update our result if there exists better results till now. Finally, if our result is still infinity, then it is impossible to meet the requirement, otherwise we return our result.

In this implementation, we use a dictionary to store each Y coordinate associated with its corresponding X coordinates set. This allows us to quickly look up which sets contain a particular Y coordinate without having to iterate over them one by one. When adding a point, we simply add it to the appropriate set. For counting, we loop through possible lengths of sides of our axis aligned rectangle and check whether they exist in adjacent sets. We divide the result by 6 since there are two opposite corners selected multiple times.

This function starts by setting `first` to `1` which represents the current position. Then it enters a loop until `n` becomes `1`. Inside this loop, depending on whether `first` is an odd number or an even one, either `first` increases or decreases by `1`. After each iteration, `n` is divided by `2`. Finally, after the loop ends, the function returns the minimum between the last element of `nums` and its reverse minus `1`. This gives us the smallest possible remaining number.

This problem involves several concepts including DFS/BFS traversal, union-find algorithm, and graph theory. The key observation here is how we should distribute our resources so they do not get overloaded when there are many connected groups of nodes. By calculating the amount of spread for every possible pair of nodes within these groups first, then sorting them based on their indices and picking out the smaller value, we ensure that any remaining nodes have the minimal spreading. Finally, if none of the values match the maximum group size

This Python function takes an input parameter `colors` as a string representing the sequence of pieces (either 'A' or 'B'). It then iterates over these characters, counting the number of times three consecutive 'A's or 'B's appear consecutively within the string. The count of 'A's and 'B's determines who wins when Alice plays first. Since we know who will win at some point, we simply need to check whether Alice's score is greater than Bob's. This gives us our final result.

This Python script uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve this problem. It maintains a queue which stores all possible states until it finds the target. For each state, it generates its successors by changing one digit, then checks whether the successor has been visited before because it might lead to a cycle. If it hasn't been visited, add it into the visited set and put it into the queue. Finally, when it reaches the target, it returns the number of steps needed; otherwise, it continues searching until there isn't anything left in the queue, in which case it returns -1 indicating failure to find the target.

This function works by maintaining a stack of open parentheses. When we encounter an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we pop from the stack because this means we have finished parsing a subexpression within our current set of parentheses. The maximum length of this stack at any given point represents the depth of the corresponding substring within the original string. We keep track of these maximum lengths throughout the entire process. At the end, the maximum length stored in the variable `max_depth` will hold the maximum depth found among all valid substrings.

This Python function uses depth first search to calculate the frequencies of all nodes from 1 to n, then it calculates how many pairs exist whose incident frequency exceeds the query result. Finally, it subtracts the occurrence of the query result itself from this total count to get the final answer. This approach works because we traverse the entire tree once before processing any further queries, thus providing a time complexity of O(n).

In this Python code, we first calculate the depths of all nodes from the root to their descendants using Depth First Search (DFS). Then, we use another DFS algorithm to find the most right node whose left child and right child have both the maximum depth. It returns the node which contains the deepest leaves. If there is more than one such node, then any of these nodes can be considered as the result. In case of multiple answers, we pick the last one.

This problem involves knowledge on heaps data structure. It has been solved using Python’s built-in libraries like heapq for priority queues. This algorithm works as follows: it maintains two heaps; one maximum heap that stores the smaller half of elements inside it, and another minimum heap that stores the larger half of elements inside it. Initially, we push all the first 'k'-sized windows into both heaps. Then, we continuously move our sliding window along, pushing the next element onto the appropriate heap until we reach the end of the array. At this point, any remaining elements in the last 'k'-sized window would have already been pushed onto their respective heaps once they were fully processed. Afterwards, we calculate the median based on whether or not the sizes of these two heaps are

This Python function counts the total amount of nice pairs by using dictionary data structure to store frequencies of each 'nice pair'. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is length of input list 'nums', which makes it efficient enough even though there might be some constraints on inputs such as size of lists or values within them. It then returns the final result after taking modulo operation because we need to find the remainder when calculating the summation due to large numbers.

The above Python function uses dynamic programming to solve this problem by keeping track of the number of vowels from the current position onwards until the end of the word. If we encounter an 'e', 'i', or 'o', we increment our counter as well since these three form the boundaries of a vowel segment. For all other characters, we reset the counter because they do not contribute to forming a vowel segment. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input word. This can handle inputs upto 105 characters long due to its nested loop structure. The space complexity is also O(N^2). It needs to store the DP table which takes up extra space proportional to the size of the input. However, due to the limitation of memory consumption, this approach will work fine even when you have very large strings.

In this Python program we first define our helper function dfs which checks whether a given substring exists in the trie by using depth-first search (dfs). We then implement the main functions addWord and search from our WordDictionary class. The dfs function starts from root and iterates over each character in the input string. If it encounters a dot, it tries out every child node; if it encounters another char, it moves to its corresponding child node. After finishing traversing the entire string, it returns true if the current node represents an end of a word, false otherwise. In addition, the addWord function adds a new word into the Trie by recursively moving through nodes until reaching the leaf node representing the last character of the word. Finally, the search function uses dfs as well to check if there exist some strings in the Trie matching the query string.

In this Python solution, we use sort function which puts elements based on some key value i.e., length of string and then alphabetic order. We initialize resultant list 'res'. Then iterate through every element from the sorted list. If it doesn't start with prev+'/', append into our final output otherwise skip it. Update 'cur' variable accordingly. Finally, return our results. This works because when checking whether a new directory name begins with the existing directories names, we ensure no overlap between these two directories since none of them share common prefixes except possibly trailing slash character.

```
In this problem we are checking whether the given binary tree is balanced or not by calculating the height difference between every pair of its children and returning -1 when that happens. This approach ensures that each subtree will be checked at least once (hence the name "depth first search"). If all subtrees are valid, then the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. In Python, you can simply use recursion to solve such problems without needing an explicit stack data structure. Just keep in mind that as the depth of your tree increases, recursive calls may consume more memory because they need to store multiple frames on the call stack.

This Python function works by creating a dynamic programming table (or 'dp') where each cell contains the minimum fall path sum ending at that location. It then returns the smallest value in the last row of this table which represents the minimum fall path sum across all locations. This problem can be solved using bottom up approach since we need to consider previous cells while calculating current cell. We start from second last row and move towards first row. For every cell, it checks whether its neighbors are on boundary or not. If neighbor exists, calculate minimum sum considering those three cases and add current cell's value. Time complexity is O(N^2), space complexity is also O(N^2). Here N is number of elements in one dimension of given input matrix.

Please note this problem requires understanding of data structures like Linked Lists and Hashmaps which are widely used in competitive programming problems. This Python program uses a technique called sliding window or prefix sum method to solve this problem efficiently. It iterates through the input link list keeping track of cumulative sums encountered upto each point and checking whether it exists as a key in a dictionary (hash map). If yes then we find a sequence starting at the previous node whose sum equals zero hence we need to skip those many nodes. We do this by connecting the next pointers of these skipped nodes. Finally, we update our reference pointer 'dummy_node'.

In this Python program, we first check whether there are exactly `2^k` possible strings from `s` (because each character in `s` could map to one bit). If they don't match, then no possible combination exists so we directly return False. Then, we create a set named `need` which stores our potential substrings of size `k`. For each index `i` where `s[i: i+k]` equals to '1' times `k`, add `s[i: i+k]` into `need`. Finally, return whether `need` contains exactly `2^k` elements. We use set data structure because checking membership takes constant time on average while list requires linear search hence using sets allows us to achieve faster lookup speeds.

This function works by iterating through each pair of adjacent elements in the input list (with one element missing at the end). It keeps track of whether the sequence increases or decreases using two boolean variables, 'increase' and 'decrease'. If we encounter a pair where both are False, that means the sequence isn't strictly increasing nor decreasing, so we immediately return False. Otherwise, after checking all pairs, we check if any of them were True; if they were, then the original list was monotonic.

In the above Python Code snippet, I used Breadth First Search approach to solve this problem. A deque data structure was created to store tuples where the first element is the reference to the TreeNode object and the second element is the x coordinate which indicates the horizontal distance from the root i.e., 'column_index'. All elements were then popped out of the front end of the queue and added to the respective column indexed list in the dictionary "columns". If there exists any left or right child node, they would get enqueued into the back end of the queue with updated coordinates. After processing all nodes, resultant output lists are returned according to ascending order of their X coordinates.

This function works by performing a standard addition operation on each digit pair from both input arrays along with the carry from previous step. The final sum can be represented as negative binary using modulo operator '%'. If there remains some carry after all digits are processed then it will be appended into the result list otherwise it won't appear in the resulting list. After that we just need to pop out any trailing zeroes from the beginning of the list since these would not contribute anything in our resultant decimal representation. Finally reversing the list before returning ensures that the least significant bits come up first which matches how they were originally read from left to right in positive binary system.

This Python function will take two parameters, a list of prices and a target. The function converts all the prices into floating point numbers. Then it iterates through possible ceil and floor values for every element in the prices array. For each iteration, it calculates the new total by adding absolute differences between the calculated maximum value and the original elements plus the absolute difference between the maximum value and next integer considering ceil operation followed by floor operation. This updated total gets compared with the target. If they match, it returns the computed ceiling value formatted as per requirement. Else, it updates the minimum difference variable with the smaller difference found till now. After traversal, if no such combination was found satisfying the condition then it returns '-1', otherwise it returns the smallest difference formatted as required.

This problem has two parts which solve separately. First part calculates the prefix sum array from the input list. Second part uses binary search on this prefix sum array to find out the best good subarray. It starts by initializing result variable with negative infinity and finding length of the list. Then it sets up two pointers at both ends of the list. In each iteration, it checks whether moving the left or right pointer could potentially give us better results. This process continues until the left pointer equals to the right one. Finally, returns the maximum score found so far.

In this Python function, we first create a new node which will be used as the 'new head'. Then we initialize our carry variable to 1. We then traverse through each element in the given linked list starting from the new head until we reach the end (i.e., when head is None). For each node, we calculate its value including the carry. If the sum exceeds 10, we set the carry to 1 otherwise it would become 0. After adding all values, we handle any remaining carry after the last iteration. In case there is still a carry left over, we append it as a new tail node. Finally, we return the updated head without the extra sentinel node.

The above Python function returns the length of the shortest subarray needing to be sorted so as to bring all numbers into non-decreasing order. This problem can be solved by using greedy algorithm but since we are asked to solve it in O(N), I used the same approach but changed some parts based on optimization. We don't actually need to physically "sort" the array because we just want to know how many swaps would be needed (not do them). Instead, we look at each pair of adjacent values and see whether they're out of order; if not, we increment our count of missing elements. After counting those, we check again to ensure no more items were missed

This Python function uses a dictionary comprehension to create counts for every character in the input list of votes. It then sorts the keys of the dictionary using lambda functions as sorting criteria. The last element of the tuple determines whether it should be placed before or after its counterpart, since it needs to break ties by comparing these elements. Finally, it joins the keys together into a single string and returns it. This approach ensures that the output matches the expected result from the provided examples.

In this Python script, we use two lists - 'result' and 'current_level'. We initialize them both as empty lists. Then we start our loop which continues until there are no more elements in 'current_level'. Inside that loop, we append each value of all nodes in 'current_level' into our 'result', then add their children to 'next_level' so they can be processed later on. Finally, we set 'current_level' equal to 'next_level' and reset 'next_level' back to an empty list so it can process new levels when needed. After processing all levels, we have our final output where each sublist contains the values of one level of the binary tree from left to right. This program works for any input binary tree since it assumes valid inputs. If the root node is null, it returns an empty list because there is nothing to do.

This Python function uses Breadth First Search approach along with a Queue data structure to find the shortest path between top left and bottom right cells of the given binary matrix. The function starts by checking whether the starting point or ending point contains any obstacles which would block the route. Then it initializes a direction list for possible movements and marks the start position as visited using mark variable. It then enters into a loop where it dequeues each cell one by one until it reaches the destination node. For every popped cell, it checks all its eight neighbors and adds them to the queue if they haven’t been visited before. When it finds the target cell, it returns the current step count. If it can't reach the target cell after visiting all nodes, it will return -1 indicating no available path.

This Python function will work perfectly fine on LeetCode but it won’t pass due to a few issues that we have discussed above. One such issue is related to setting or getting null nodes which might lead to NullPointerException if not handled properly. It can be solved by adding check before accessing any member of ImmutableListNode like so:

```python
if head == None: return
# rest of your implementation...
```
It should also handle cases when there isn't enough memory available i.e., Linked List size exceeds Integer Limit, as well as negative integer values etc. These scenarios would require more advanced handling approaches depending upon specific requirements. For instance, one could consider breaking down large lists into smaller chunks or implementing recursive approach to deal with these situations.

The above Python function uses an iterative approach to solve this problem by using a stack and keeping track of the previous value visited during traversal. For every node, it first goes left until there are no more left children, then pops out from the stack, calculates the diff with previous value and updates the result if necessary. Finally, moves on to right subtree. It keeps doing these steps till all nodes have been processed. At each step, it compares the current node val with previous value and update the minimum difference accordingly.

```
In this Python function, we first define the constant `MOD` which will help us avoid overflow when calculating the result modulo `1e9+7` in each iteration. Then we initialize variables to keep track of our current character and its position, and the total summation. We start iterating over the input string from left to right. For every unique character at index `i`, we find out how many substrings end there by comparing the next occurrence of that character or reaching the last occurrence of that character. Each substring has equal lengths so we calculate the area of rectangle using formula `n*(n+1)/2` where n is the length of the substring. Multiply the calculated area by frequency of that character then add it to our final answer. After finishing one loop, move our starting point to the next non-unique character. This process continues until no more unique characters can be found in remaining part of the string. At last, return the computed value modulo `1e9+7`.

```  
In this solution we first convert input to list of tuples where each tuple consists of character from string 's' and its negative index which will be used when sorting the array. After that, we add empty strings at both ends because they have no prefixes so it can easily handle concatenating operation later on. We then call Python built-in function sorted(). This method sorts an iterable object based on some criteria such as length or ASCII value etc., by default it sorts elements in ascending order but here we pass our custom comparison logic through lambda functions inside sorted(). In every iteration, we compare current character with previous one according to the rules mentioned above. If condition matches then append characters before them otherwise append next char. At the end, resultant output would be the largest possible substring after sorting.

In this solution we first create a list 'prefix_sum', where each cell represents the total sum of numbers up to that position in our original array/matrix. Then, for every valid start point (x, y), we calculate the current "window" or subarray which has size at most two rows down and two columns right, then subtract any overlapping parts from it using four previous computations stored in 'prefix_sum'. We keep track of these totals globally, but also update our result whenever we encounter a larger window so far. This way we can always get the global maximum sum while keeping memory usage low. Note that this approach runs in O(mn^2). For better performance you could implement a more efficient algorithm like Kadane’s Algorithm.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of cells in the input matrix (in this case, the length of the "colsum" list). This is because we traverse through every cell once. The space complexity is also O(N), due to storing the output matrix. Here, N represents the size of the input matrix.

This problem requires knowledge about depth-first search algorithm and table data structure which are fundamental to solving this problem. In Python, you could solve it by using built-in functions like list comprehension, join(), pop(). Also, we need to keep track of visited characters to avoid repeating the same character when building our candidates. This kind of problem would require strong understanding of data structures such as lists or tables.

This function works by first counting the occurrences of each value in the input list, then repeatedly choosing the smallest and largest values until no more unique averages can be found. It uses Python's built-in Counter data structure to count frequencies efficiently. After finding an average, it removes both the minimum and maximum counts from the counter, since they have already been used up once. This continues until all values have been processed. Finally, it returns the size of the set of computed averages which represents the number of distinct averages.

```
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by maintaining a table 'dp', where each cell 'dp[i][j]' stores the minimum possible maximum sum we could get from splitting 'nums[:j+1]' into 'i' parts. The base case would be when there is only one partition, which means 'nums[:j+1]' contains just one element so its maximum sum should be itself. Then we fill up the rest cases according to formula:
    $$dp[i][j]= \min_{k<j} \{max(suffix[j]-suffix[k], dp[i-1][k]) \} $$
where suffix[j] represents sum of all elements after index j including those at position j, and suffix[k] represents sum till index k inclusive. We use the previous result if current partition doesn't make sense or has too many partitions thus storing them in variable 'curr_sum'. After filling out whole matrix, our final result will be stored in dp[m-1][n]. Here n is total number of elements. Time complexity is O(n^2), space complexity is also O(n).

The above Python code uses prefix sum technique to solve this problem efficiently. It first counts the number of operations needed at each position using "count" list. Then sorts these counts and original lists before performing multiplication and addition respectively to find out the final output. This process takes O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting. Hence overall time complexity would be approximately O(n log n). Space complexity is also O(n), as we need extra space to store our results after sorting.

In above code, we use BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in graph. The main idea behind BFS is to visit all neighboring vertices/nodes of current vertex before visiting those of its unvisited neighbors. In our case, we consider each word as a node and there exists an edge from one word to another when their characters differ but they are adjacent according to the problem constraints. Then we need to maintain the state of visited indices so that same indices do not get processed again. Hence we used hash set 'visited'. Also note that we have considered starting point itself as part of our result. Time complexity would be O(N), where N is total number of words.

This problem requires understanding of data structures like counters in Python or using sorting algorithms on lists. It also uses basic string manipulation techniques such as counting frequencies. The key idea here is keeping track of minimum possible deletions required so far when considering each distinct letter/character in increasing order based on their counts. If next letter has same count then increment its count by deleted counts otherwise move forward to next unique letter. This process ensures deleting maximum amount of occurrences but maintaining uniqueness of all remaining elements which satisfies condition given in this problem.

This problem can be solved by using mathematical properties and some bit manipulation tricks. We first convert the input number into decimal form which allows us to use basic arithmetic operations directly on it. Then we try out every possible good base starting from m-1 upwards until we find one that works. If such a base doesn't exist, then there must be at least two other factors that multiply together to make the original number, so we simply return the number itself multiplied by 2. The reason behind checking till m is because we have to ensure each factor starts from 2 or more than 2. After finding the best base, we turn back our result to its original base form. This algorithm runs in O(log N^(1/b)), where N is the given number and b is the desired base. So overall time complexity will be approximately O(N^(1/b)).

This function works as follows: firstly, we define helper functions 'rotate' that takes a square matrix (which means its dimension is NxN), and returns a new matrix where original one has been turned 90 degree clockwise. Then we have main function which tries all rotation combinations until it finds such combination whose input matrix turns into target matrix or no more rotation could be made anymore. If none of these rotation matches, then it returns False; otherwise, it returns True after finding at least one matching rotation. The time complexity is O(N^2).

This Python function first initializes an array "count" filled by zeros which counts the occurrences of numbers that have appeared so far in this subtree. It then checks each branch of the tree using depth-first search (dfs), updating the 'count' list as we go along. If at any point during our traversal, there exists more than one occurrence of a digit appearing odd times, or when we reach a leaf node but haven't found all possible paths, we immediately return False indicating that the current path isn't valid. Otherwise, after checking every single path, we increment our result variable by one. Finally, once all branches have been checked, we return the total amount of valid paths.

The above function works by using binary search on the matrix indices. It starts from the top right corner and moves towards the left until it finds the target value. If at any point the middle element is less than the target then that means we need to move towards lower values so we set our new high pointer as mid - 1 otherwise we keep setting our new low pointer as mid + 1. This process continues till the low becomes more than high i.e., when there is no match found. Finally, if none of them matches, it returns false indicating the target does not exist in the array.

This Python program uses Depth-First Search algorithm to solve this problem. The function "combinationSum" calls private method "dfs". DFS goes through every possible subset including empty subsets as well by starting its search from the first element until no more items left or until we reach our desired sum. If the current path sums equal to the target, adds it to the results. Else if the current path sums exceeds the target, stops further exploration because paths longer than target cannot have their sum smaller than target. For each item in the remaining set, makes recursive call while excluding duplicated solutions. This approach ensures uniqueness among groups where same number could be selected multiple times.

This Python function uses two data structures (a list for sorting, and a max-heap). It iterates through each interval, checking whether it overlaps with any existing room or not. If yes, then add its duration to that room; otherwise, create a new room. By doing so, we ensure that no more than one person can attend at any given moment due to conflicting schedules. Finally, the length of our maximum-sized heap indicates the total number of conferences needed. This algorithm runs in O(n log n), as we need to sort the input and use a heap structure which has logarithmic complexity operations.

This Python program uses dynamic programming and bit manipulation to solve this problem. The function `countSubgraphs()` first constructs the adjacency list representation of the graph using the input edges. Then it defines a helper function `dp()` to calculate the number of valid paths ending at each node considering all possible states including those containing certain bits. Finally, it returns the results obtained by calling the helper function for all possible masks. Note that we use LRU cache decorator (@lru_cache(None)) because calculating the same value multiple times can be costly.

In this Python program, we first create a new matrix 'pre_sum'. The value at index (i, j) will be the sum till point (i, j). Then for every element in original matrix, add it to corresponding cell in pre_sum. After that we iterate through each cell in given matrix and calculate its surrounding cells in pre_sum which gives us required output. Time complexity is O(N^2) where N is max(K, R, C). This is because we are traversing all possible positions twice. Space complexity is also O(N^2) as well due to creation of pre_sum matrix.

In this Python function, we first create two lists 'left' and 'right'. The values in these lists represent the minimum distances to the nearest occupied seat on either side of each seat. We iterate through our input list once, filling up these lists based on whether there is an occupied seat on either side. Afterwards, we calculate the result by finding the minimum value among all non-occupied seats separated by both sides, which gives us the maximum distance to the closest person. If no non-occupied seats exist, it returns 0 as expected.

In this solution we use depth-first search along with dynamic programming to solve the problem. We keep track of the costs at all positions by maintaining a list 'cost'. Then, using dynamic programming, we calculate the best case scenario when distributing the remaining products among the retailers starting from position 0 upwards. Finally, we add together all cases resulting from storing certain quantity into our final result. This approach ensures that every retailer gets exactly their intended quantity of products and minimizes the total fee.

This problem requires understanding of priority queues, dynamic programming, and sorting algorithms. The key idea here is to maximize the number of courses we can take while minimizing the total time spent studying each course. We keep track of the cumulative sum of all course durations as well as the maximum heap representing the currently active courses. If a new course starts, we try to add it to our heap; otherwise, we replace the largest-durability course with this one. Eventually, the size of the heap represents the maximum number of courses we can take.

Also we can use bitwise operation which is faster than looping through each digit and checking every single condition. Bit manipulation trick '&', '>>=', '<<=' are used here. The binary representation of any non-negative integer always ends with either zero or one (either even or odd). Therefore, when n & (n-1) equals zero, this means n is a power of two.

In above code, I have first checked if the input number `n` is greater than 0 because numbers less than 0 cannot be powers of 2 as per definition provided in problem statement. Then using bitwise AND operator ('&'), I am comparing the result of subtracting 1 from `n` until no bits left in the right side i.e., all zeros except last set bit where last set bit would contain some value other than zero (which indicates `n` is not a power of 2), so after doing this comparison again, if both sides equal to zero, it implies `n` was indeed a power of 2. This method takes advantage of properties of integers that allows us to directly perform operations on them. It also avoids having to manually implement the logic required to determine if a number is a power of 2 by leveraging the property of how integers work in computer memory.

This Python function uses depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) constructed based on 'richer' relationship between people. DFS visits nodes in topological order as soon as possible because we want to find the "least quiet" person first. For every person, its "most quiet" person is found by performing DFS starting from this person. This way, we ensure that we always get the most quiet person when visiting a particular person. If there exists someone else who is quieter than current person then his quietness is updated accordingly. We keep track of results in 'res'. At last, result[] gives us the index of minimum quietness person for each individual person.

This Python function works by first defining helper functions to help us manipulate our lists and find the maximum possible list of length 'k'. Then it uses these helper functions to create all possible combinations of choosing 'k' elements from each list (upto their total length). It then returns the maximum among those results. Note that this algorithm has time complexity O((k^2)*m*n) which may not fit into real life scenarios due to large inputs but should work fine on reasonable input sizes.

This problem can be solved using a single pass through the input list by keeping track of the smallest two negative values (which will become positive when multiplied), the largest two positive values, and the largest value. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(N). To improve it to linear time complexity, we need to use additional space to store intermediate results which makes the algorithm more complex.

This Python function uses two pointers approach to solve this problem. The first pointer (index) traverses through the whole input string 'p'. Each time we meet a character in 'p', we check whether there exists a continuous sequence in 'p' whose characters form a valid substring of one word in 'words'. If yes, we add its starting position into result list. After checking each possible subsequence, we move forward by moving the second pointer ('index') until we reach the last possible position where we could have found such sequences. Finally, we return the result list as our final answer.

In this code, we first sort the ranges by their starting point. Then we iterate over each range and check whether its ending point should be extended or not. If an overlap occurs, then extend the current interval; otherwise create a new interval from the next one. Finally, subtract the total number of non-overlapping ranges which can be calculated as "pow(2,non-overlap)" minus 1 since each element has been counted twice (once when counting overlaps). The result will be modulus 1e9+7 due to overflow issue.

This problem has overlapping subproblems, so we need dynamic programming approach to solve it efficiently. We use top down DP method here. For each event, there are two choices either include it or exclude it. If we decide to include it then the next possible maximum sum would be considering all remaining events till now plus the included event's value. And if we decided to exclude it then our result remains same because we don’t change anything but just go ahead with the remaining events. To handle overlaps between different events, we check whether their starting day is less than or equal to the current event's ending day before deciding whether to include/exclude it. This reduces unnecessary computation. Finally, we get the final result from bottom up manner.

This problem involves creating subsets of certain types of strings (possible conversions), then checking whether these subsets correspond to valid targets. It has complexity O(n^2). Here n represents length of longest input string. This algorithm runs efficiently even when there are many different substrings available as potential starting points. However, it might take a long time because of large number of inputs. A faster approach would involve using dynamic programming or graph theory concepts to reduce the search space.

The difference count gives us the total number of flips required to convert the current state into the desired state. This result is then added up over all the elements in the input string to get the final answer.

ref:
def max_difference(num):
    a = num + 9 - (num % 10)
    b = num - (num // 1000 % 10) * 111

    return a - b

This function works as follows: it creates a new dictionary where keys are tuples that represent the sorted characters of words (from input), and values are lists of words themselves (anagrams). It then sorts each string in the given list and adds it to the corresponding tuple entry in this dictionary. Finally, it returns a list of these entries which represents groups of anagrams.

```
This Python function calculates the minimum possible difference between the total path taken by the squirrel to collect all the nuts and place them under the tree while avoiding any nut collision or same nut placement as the tree. It takes into account that if you want to minimize the overall movement cost, it is more beneficial to avoid placing the nut on top of the tree compared to moving directly to it. Therefore, we subtract the total distance moved by the squirrel to the positions of its nuts from the sum of the absolute differences in their paths to the trees. This gives us the optimal way to get there.

        return n == 1 or (n - 1) % 3 == 0 # If we can form 'n', then either n itself or n-1 forms a valid combination as per problem statement.
```
This Python function uses a greedy approach where it tries to divide `n` by 3 until `n` becomes less than 3. It returns True when `n` equals one at last which means all numbers upto this point are valid combinations. In case however `n` still remains greater than zero after division, it checks whether subtracting 1 from `n` results in another valid combination. This way, regardless of how many times `n` divides into 3, we will eventually reach `n` being equal to 1, indicating any number upto this point could be used as part of a larger valid combination.

```
In the above Python code, we first define a helper function named "getNext" that calculates the next value based on input 'n'. It takes each digit from rightmost side of 'n', square it and add to 'totalSum'. Then it returns 'totalSum'. In our main method, we have two pointers called slow and fast where slow pointer moves one step at a time and fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there exists a loop then slow and fast would eventually meet. The reason why they meet here is because the speed doubles after every iteration so when they met, their speeds were equal hence returning False as mentioned earlier. But if they didn't meet, means no loop existed thus returning True.

def get_next(n):
    sum = 0

This problem requires knowledge about backtracking algorithms and bit manipulation. The solution uses binary masks to iterate through all possible pairs of requests that could be made. In each iteration, it updates the count of employees in different buildings based on the type of request being made. Then it checks if this configuration meets the requirement of having no more than half of the buildings filled up. Finally, it updates the maximum count accordingly when needed.

This problem can be solved using depth first search (DFS). We use recursion to check all possible matches from each character of the pattern. If we have found a matching substring in the given text, then we move on to the next character in the pattern. Otherwise, we backtrack by resetting the dictionary entry corresponding to this character to an empty string. This ensures that no two characters share the same index position in the original sentence.

This function works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n` using a loop. For each iteration, it checks if the current number does not cause overflow when added to the previous number (or the maximum allowable number so far). If it doesn't, it adds this number directly without incrementing the counter. Otherwise, it adds the next largest available number before incrementing the counter. This way, the smallest number of patches needed will always be returned. Note that this algorithm assumes that the input array `nums` is already sorted.

Testing it on a sample test case gives us correct results:

```
Please note that the above solution uses binary shift operation instead of arithmetic operations to achieve the target goal. This approach has better performance compared to other solutions because it reduces the number of shifts by half each iteration while doing the actual division process. However, Python doesn’t support shifting n bits directly like C++ or Java does. Therefore, you need to use "<<" operator twice in line 9 and 10.

```
In the provided Python function, I used dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The 'dp' array stores the maximum value at each step while traversing through the input string 's'. At each position 'i', the current number has upto 15 digits (for j). If bit 'j' in mask 'k' exists in last digit ('d'), then new number will be max(current,last * 10 + next), otherwise keep as it is. And when adding another digit, there should be no carry over from previous bits since these numbers would never exceed limit [10^j - 10*(1 << j)]. So, we need to update mask 'k | (1 << j)' also. Then check whether the difference between ith character and first digit after ith character is greater than or equals to 1, if yes then calculate accordingly and store in 'dp[i + 1][j][mask]' considering both cases where ith character itself can be part of some other substring or it cannot.

In this Python program, we use two stacks to solve this problem. We iterate over the given list of bars, maintaining a decreasing order on top of our 'bar stack'. If current bar is shorter than the one at the top of the stack, it means we can calculate its area using these bars as long as they form a longer rectangle because their shortest side will always be at the bottom of the stack. Otherwise, we keep popping out the smaller bars from the stack until the current bar is shorter or the stack becomes empty. Then we update our maximum area by comparing the calculated areas after removing all bars from the stack. In the end, we return the maximum area found.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming where you maintain a state dp[i][j], which represents the number of ways to get the result 'j' from i dice throws. Dynamic Programming states are calculated as follows: For each die throw, consider all possible results up to its limit (in this case, 'k'), and update your current state by adding those new possibilities. Modulo operation ensures the final output does not exceed the maximum allowable size of long integers on some platforms.

```
This Python code works by maintaining an array `days[]` representing how many times we have had a customer coming up on different hours. Then, starting from the end of this list, we iterate through all possible opening hours until we reach one where no customers came up. We calculate two cases:

- When a new customer comes up before our current hour, then we add the difference between these two hours to our running sum `total_days`. This represents any additional work needed because a new customer arrived after our previous openings but didn’t close them yet.

- If a customer doesn’t come up during our current hour, then we simply increment our running sum `total_days` by adding our current hour. In such case, we need not do anything else because the next customer will definitely come up soon.

Finally, we take modulo of 24 since we consider each hour separately. The result should either be less than 24 and greater than or equal to zero or equals to 24, depending upon whether a customer has already been served within the same clock cycle. So we use min function to get the smallest value among those possibilities.

This problem has a time complexity of O(n^3). We use brute force to solve this problem and iterate over all possible triangles. For each triangle, we calculate its area using Heron's formula then compare it with our current maximum area. If new area is larger than previous one, update our result. This approach works because every point belongs to exactly two other points so we have four possibilities when choosing which two points form a line segment. Hence total combinations are nC4, hence time complexity remains constant regardless of input size. Space complexity would also remain constant as well due to usage of extra space to store variables and not considering output parameter.

This problem requires knowledge about binary search algorithm and its application on row wise sorted matrices. It involves finding out the first occurrence of "1" in the bottom right hand side of the matrix. The reason why this works because after scanning the whole matrix, the final value would be the left most column with "1". We start searching from the bottom right end (last cell), whenever we encounter a zero, we move towards the next row (upwards) since we know that these cells contain at least one '1'. Once we find a '1', we try to go further down but don’t need to check whether there exists another '1' before it due to our constraint i.e., the columns must be sorted in descending order. Hence, we just skip those entries whose values are zeros. This approach helps us achieve O(n+m) time complexity, n and m being number of rows and columns respectively.

In above Python Code :
We use two heaps, one max heap to handle selling orders and another min heap to handle buying orders. While processing any order we check whether its type is 'Buy' or 'Sell'. Depending on the type, we perform appropriate operations. We always ensure our transactions maintain their fairness through using both types of orders appropriately. Also, note how negative sign used when pushing into Buy/Sell heap as Python’s heapq module uses min heap by default but we want maximum value hence negate values during push operation. Finally, once every transaction is completed, add up

This Python function sorts the given LinkedList by comparing each pair of adjacent elements (i.e., every two numbers). If the absolute value of one number is less than the other, it swaps them. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, at which point the sorted LinkedList is returned. Note that this algorithm assumes that the input LinkedList is correctly constructed; i.e., all elements have distinct positive and negative values. It also uses additional space proportional to the size of the output LinkedList. Its time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the LinkedList. This could be improved to O(n log n) via a different approach.

This problem can be solved using Python programming language without any extra space as well as time complexity of this approach is O(n^2). The transposing part takes O(n^2) time while reversal also does that but it will take constant amount of additional memory due to reverse operation so overall we get O(n^2) time complexity.

In this problem we have used three pointers (slow,fast & previous). We moved 'slow' pointer by one node at a time until end of list i.e., when fast becomes null then move it upto slow which will give us mid point where list gets divided into two halves. Then we reversed the second half using 'previous'. After that we merged these two parts together but need to make sure they were correctly connected because after merging there should be no cycle created between them. For correctness checking I made use of third pointer "first" initially pointing towards head of first part and its next being our current node "second". While moving through both parts we just swapped their links ensuring connection remains intact. This way we successfully managed to solve the problem.

This Python function uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. It creates a table where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum length of a palindrome contained within the substring s[i..j]. The base case is when there are one character (in this case, it is itself a palindrome), so every character gets its own substring which is also a palindrome. Then we check all substrings of length two and move towards longer ones. If characters at current positions match, then we extend our previous palindrome; otherwise, we take the maximum between the next non-matching pair. Finally, the required length will be stored in dp[0][n-1], as it denotes the entire input string.

This Python function uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It first calculates how many ways we can sort strings ending at each position by increasing or decreasing from the previous character. Then it sums up these counts taking into account the total count taken so far. This gives us the result after performing all required operations. Modulo operator is used to ensure the final result does not exceed maximum limit. Time complexity is O(N), where N is length of input string. Space complexity is also O(N).

This Python function works by first counting all 'B' symbols from the beginning until the last but not including k. Then we calculate the result as the average value of these counts divided by their absolute values. If any count is negative, this means some 'W' symbol was found before the current position, so we cannot make more consecutive 'K' blocks, therefore we return -1. Otherwise, we return the result.

This function works by calculating the profitability of each worker relative to his/her quality, then sorts these profits based on quality. It forms pairs of quality and its corresponding profit which help us identify out optimal number of workers to form a paid group.

This Python function uses Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible arrangements of N Queens placements under certain constraints. It starts from leftmost column and tries to place Q at current position till it reaches rightmost column. If any arrangement leads to invalid move then it skips that particular cell and moves forward until we get next valid one. Once found our desired arrangement then appending it into result list which finally returns after searching entire possible arrangements. For every new arrangement it generates its representation by converting it into string format so that can be used easily later like output.

This Python function uses prefix sum technique to solve this problem efficiently. It sorts all the rectangles based on their bottom sides, then iterates over the points from left to right, keeping track of the total number of overlapping rectangles upto any specific point. The time complexity is O(n^2 + mlogm + nmlogn) which can be optimized using binary search or segment tree data structure but since this optimization will increase your runtime significantly, you might want to focus more on optimizing the algorithm itself rather than worry about the actual implementation.

This problem belongs to category "Dynamic Programming" which requires knowledge about state transition equations. In this case we have created a matrix where each element denotes the probability of reaching from current position to destination by taking any number of steps. We initially set all elements equal to zero except our starting point. Then for every step count we increment corresponding entry of DP table. After K steps we simply need to calculate average value of probabilities over all reachable states because once again these values represent the final result. This approach ensures correctness due to constraints mentioned above. Time complexity depends on 'K', which is constant since we iterate through it fixed times. Space complexity is O(n^2).

The function 'findLucky' takes input as list of integers 'arr'. It uses counter object from Python’s collection module to get dictionary where key will be elements in the list and corresponding values will be their frequencies. Then it iterates over keys (which are unique lucky numbers), checks whether they have same frequency as themselves or not, if yes then updates maximum value variable which stores highest lucky number found so far. Finally returns maximum value after traversing through whole dict. In case there are no luckies i.e., no element occurs more than once in the list, this method will return -1.

This problem can be solved by using Depth First Search (DFS). We start from the root node and recursively call our DFS method for its left child first, before calling it for right child. If current depth of the node is even, we don’t need to change this node; otherwise, we swap its left and right subtree. In order to check whether the current depth is odd, we use modulo operation. Finally, we return modified node as result. This way, every time when we reach an odd depth, our algorithm will traverse through all the nodes at that depth, hence ensuring that all odd level nodes get reversed.

This problem could be solved by using depth first search (DFS). Firstly, create a adjacency list representation of the graph. Then use DFS to visit each node exactly once. For each node, calculate its value including itself and add up the values of its children into this calculation. After visiting all nodes, check whether the calculated total score is greater than previous best one or not. If yes, then update the result variable. Finally, after visiting all nodes, return the maximum score found during DFS process. In case none of them satisfies the condition, return -1 directly.

This function loops through each number in the input list 'nums'. For every number it checks all numbers from 1 upto square root of that number as per the problem statement. It counts how many factors are present by checking whether a factor exists or not. If both factors exist then we add those two together otherwise just one. In end, if total factors equals 4 and largest divisor doesn't exceed limit 10^4 then we include this number along with its largest divisor into our result. At last we return the final summation of these values. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(m)*m), where m is the size of the given list. This makes it efficient even for large inputs.

This function works by first creating a copy of the original string as a list. Then it iterates over the indices, replacing the corresponding index in the new list with the character from the original string. Finally, it joins all elements of the new list into a single string using join() method and returns this result. This approach uses O(n) extra space because we create a new list which could contain upto n characters. It also takes linear time (O(n)), where n is the number of characters in the input strings.

In this Python program, we define a function called "cycleLengthQueries" which takes as parameters 'n', a positive integer representing the number of nodes on one side of the complete binary tree, and 'queries'. This parameter should be a list of lists containing pairs of integers. Our task here is to compute the length of cycles within the tree based on the provided queries.

The helper method 'depth' calculates the maximum depth or height of the tree from the start point down to a leaf node by shifting the bits until reaching zero. Then it computes the total distance covered during traversal along the cycle using bitwise operations. It checks whether the starting point and end point have different depths; if they do, then there must be a cycle present somewhere in the middle of the tree due to constraints mentioned in the problem statement. If both points have equal depth, then the lengths of cycles can differ but since we want them to add up modulo 2, we need to calculate how many steps will take us out of the cycle when moving back towards the original position. Finally, all computed results are appended into result list and returned.

In this Python function, we first create an array (or list) called "count" which contains the counts of each digit from 'low' to 'high'. Then, we use Python built-in function str.count() on every element in the "count" list to get how many times digit 'd' appears in each number within given range. Finally, we calculate the total occurrence by adding up those numbers where condition satisfied (e.g., digit 'd' appear more than or equal to 'd'). This result will be returned by the function.

In this solution, we use a dictionary to store each unique message and its corresponding latest timestamp.

We update the last timestamp for this message whenever a new message arrives.

This Python implementation uses two pointers approach where one pointer iterates over the valid elements and another points towards the last element of invalid elements. The map stores mappings between original indexes and their corresponding positions in the mapped index space [0...n-m). Then whenever we need to choose a random unoccupied slot, we check whether this slot is occupied or not by looking up its mapping. If yes then take it as our result otherwise randomly select among remaining slots. This way we avoid calling built-in rand() function multiple times thus optimizing time complexity. Please note that we also keep track of total unique numbers available so that when choosing a random slot we can make sure it doesn’t conflict with anything already picked earlier. We use get method because if key is not found in dictionary it returns None instead of throwing KeyError exception.

This problem can be solved using Union-Find algorithm which allows us to keep track of disjoint sets efficiently. The idea is simple; create a forest or tree structure by merging small subsets into larger ones. For every edge (u, v), it means two vertices u and v belong to same set. We use this information to decide whether merge them or not. If they don't belong to the same set then merge them else do nothing because these points are already connected. At last, result will be equal to number of disjoint trees minus one as each node has at least one edge pointing towards itself.

This Python function finds the longest subsequence where differences are greater than or equal to one. The idea behind this approach is that we can use dynamic programming (DP). We maintain two arrays `dp` and `dp2` such that `dp[i]` represents the largest sequence ending at index `i` which satisfies the condition and `dp2[i]` does the same but not necessarily satisfy the condition. Then we update these values based on whether the difference between current element and previous element is positive or negative. Finally, we find out the maximum value among all sequences by comparing their lengths. This problem has many edge cases and it needs careful handling to ensure correctness.

This Python function takes as input the root of a binary tree and returns all possible root-to-leaf paths as lists of strings. It uses depth-first search to traverse the tree and constructs each path by appending the values of its nodes along the way. This results in a list of such paths that can be returned directly from the function without further processing. If the current node is a leaf, it simply converts its value into a string and adds this to the result list. Finally, the function returns the resulting list of paths.

In this Python code we first define helper functions 'find', which finds the representative (parent) of a particular node by traversing upwards from the current node until it reaches its own parent or itself. The function 'union', then performs the Union operation using the disjoint set data structure algorithm. We sort all the distances among all possible connections and iterate over each connection. If both nodes of the connection do not have same parents, perform Union operation and add their respective distances to our total sum. Finally, return the total sum which represents the minimal cost to connect all points.

This problem requires understanding how dynamic programming works which includes state transition equation and finding optimal solutions using it. In this case we use DP where we keep track of all possible combinations by changing some elements at most once till now while keeping a record of our progress. We then compare these possibilities with each other until we find one which fits best with current requirement. This kind of approach helps us solve complex problems more efficiently. The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(n^2), n being the size of string 's'. It might take you quite some time due to high number of nested loops. But the concept

The `__init__` function initializes an empty list called 'requests'. The `ping` function appends the current time into 'requests', then it searches from the beginning until the oldest request is older than 3000 ms ago. It finally returns the size of remaining elements in the 'requests' list minus index i since these are all old requests before the newest one. This approach guarantees O(n) complexity due to search operation inside loop.

```
The function `convert()` converts binary representation of each row of seats into an integer value. The variable `invalid_positions` stores all possible combinations of seating arrangements which have no adjacent seats between them. Finally, we calculate the maximum number of students who can attend the exam by iterating over every combination of seats arrangement and counting how many of them are also present in `invalid_positions`. This counts the number of students who can view their own seat and teachers from either side. For example, if you have two students sitting beside each other while one teacher sits opposite, this would add three more students to your count because both of them could view the third student and teacher as well.

```
This problem requires understanding how to find minimum time using greedy algorithm. Here we consider the hens as moving one step at a time from their current position to the next possible location which will contain the nearest grain. If it doesn’t cross over the max grain then it moves directly otherwise it needs to turn around because there may still have some remaining pieces after turning around. This process repeats until no more piece could be moved due to reaching max grain. So total number of steps required would be equal to length of hens plus count of times when evenly distributed grain falls within mid range of its index.

This function will check every starting value from 1 and see if it makes all numbers in the list greater or equal to this starting value. It returns the smallest starting value which does not make any number negative. In case no suitable starting value exists, it just starts checking from next integer.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we iterate through all elements once and space complexity is also O(n). The reason being, since we need to store all indices which takes up extra memory compared to just storing the 'target'. But at worst case scenario when every element equals to target, it would give us n choices (all elements). Hence the worst case time complexity remains same but better than linear one. In best cases though, they both become constant due to the nature of problem constraints.

This function works by iterating over every point on the input matrix. For each such point, it generates all possible shifts that could be applied to create shifted versions of the matrix. It then counts how many times these shifts occur in this new version of the matrix. The maximum count of such shifts gives us the score we need.

In this Python solution, firstly I check whether it’s possible to place some ships between (0,0) and your desired location through `hasShips()` method. If yes then I use Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to mark all the cells where there is a ship in grid[][] array. Then finally calculate the total number of unique cell marked inside our defined rectangular region via counting distinct numbers returned by DFS traversal. This approach works because it ensures no overlap occurs among different regions.

This function first sorts the given input 'points'. It does this using Python's built-in Timsort algorithm which has average time complexity O(n log n). After sorting, we iterate through these sorted points checking whether there is overlap between every pair of successive points. When finding an overlap, we simply skip to next point because they don’t need to be considered again. This results in us having constant space usage so the overall time complexity remains O(n), making it efficient even when dealing with large inputs.
