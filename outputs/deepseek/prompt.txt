This Python function takes in two lists of polynomial nodes, which represent the two polynomials being added. It uses a 'dummy' node at the beginning of the resultant linked list to simplify adding new nodes into the final list. Then it iterates over both given lists simultaneously until one list gets exhausted. Depending on whether the current coefficients of the two polys match, it adds either the corresponding poly from each list directly, or computes their product and creates a new poly Node accordingly. If all polys have been processed, then any remaining poly will simply be attached to the end of the resulting list. This way, the time complexity remains O(N), but space complexity increases due to additional usage of pointers and memory allocation.

ref:
class PolyNode:
    def __init__(self, c: int, p: int, next: 'PolyNode' = None):

This Python function calculates the beauty of every possible substring by iterating over it and calculating the maximum and minimum character counts within each substring using dictionary data structure. It then adds up these differences (maximum minus minimum) to get the final result. Note that this function assumes that we have already implemented the 'freq_count' helper function which returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in the given input string.

```  
This function first counts the occurrences of each number using the Counter class from Python's built-in collections module. Then it sorts the numbers by their frequencies in ascending order and then in descending order if two numbers have the same frequency because we want to ensure that smaller numbers come before larger ones when their frequencies are equal. The key argument in the sort method specifies this behavior.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N). Where N is the length of operations list. This is because we only perform single pass through the operations list once. Space complexity is also O(1) since no extra space proportional to input size is used.

This Python code uses depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to determine whether or not we can partition the people based on their dislikes. It creates an adjacency list representation of the problem's input data structure using default dictionary. Then it calls DFS function which tries to assign each non-visited node with different color then returns False when there exists any cycle formed by these assigned nodes. If no such cycles exist then finally True will be returned indicating possibility of partitioning.

            return True

```
This Python program checks if all letters of the alphabet appear at least once in the provided sentence by using sets. If each character of the alphabet has been found in the sentence, then it means that the sentence is a pangram because each letter of the English Alphabet appears at least once. This is achieved through creating a set out of the sentence which automatically removes any duplicate characters due to its nature as a data structure representing unordered collections of unique items. The length of this resulting set will tell us how many unique letters were present in our input sentence. We compare this number with 26, since we know that there are 26 letters in the English alphabet. If they match, then we can conclude that the sentence is indeed a pangram. Otherwise, not all letters have appeared in the sentence so we return False.

```
This solution uses two pointers and sliding window technique to find out the maximum length of the subarray that has at most one '0'. It keeps track of the count of zeros as well so that when we encounter more than one '0', we can slide our left pointer forward until the count becomes less than or equal to one. This way, we ensure that every time we meet an '0', we are sure that the current subarray will have at most one '0'. Also, keep updating our result (maxLen). We stop when we reach the end of the list. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is also O(n), due to storing all elements in the list.

This Python script uses the built-in 'collections.Counter', which returns a dictionary containing how many times each integer appears in the input iterable. It then builds a max heap using these counts, and repeatedly removes the topmost entry from the heap until its empty. This effectively "rotates" all entries around such that every second entry gets removed, resulting in a sorted sequence based on their appearance frequencies. The script also handles edge cases like when there's only one unique number remaining in the final iteration.

In this Python code, we use depth-first search approach to solve the problem. The idea is to generate all sequences that start with given indices i, j and end at index n-1. If any such sequence matches our condition then we return True else false. For checking conditions like adding next element of current sequence to last two elements will cause integer overflow or does not match with remaining part of string after considering these prefixes. We do recursive calls until there are no more paths left to explore. This way we ensure the validity

This Python function creates an empty list named 'dummy' with -1 as its value (the initial head of our final Binary Search Tree). Then it uses recursive method which traverse all the nodes in order (Left-Root-Right), updating each visited node's "previous" link to point back to itself after setting up the linked list structure correctly. Finally, it returns the next node from the beginning of the original tree i.e., before changing the direction of pointers. Hence we get our answer by returning the last remaining node after traversing the entire tree. It follows the rules mentioned in problem statement without any assumptions or constraints about input size etc.

The time complexity of this function is O(logN), where logN is the base-2 logarithm of N. The space complexity is also O(logN). This is because at most there will be 31 different integers less than or equal to N, thus it needs up to 32 spaces to store them. Additionally, counting frequencies takes linear time hence its contribution to overall time complexity is linear too.

This function works by maintaining a sliding window approach with two pointers `l` and `r` where we increment `r` until our current window contains all characters of `t`. Then we slide this window towards the right by increasing the left pointer `l` until the size of the current window is smaller than previous smallest windows found so far. We keep track of the shortest length window as soon as possible after each iteration. This ensures that we always get to the optimal result. It also uses a dictionary to count how many times each character appears in `t`.

The above solution uses a greedy approach with dynamic programming to find out minimum number of operations required to make all characters same as they appear in original sequence by comparing them character wise. It first generates pairs where each pair consists of index and character at current position in second string. Then it sorts these pairs based on their indices. After this step, iterate through sorted list again and calculate minimum possible steps needed to transform first string into second using previous knowledge about transformations done till now. This way we ensure that every operation performed during iteration has been considered properly before moving forward. Finally, get maximum value among last element of DP array or initially assumed infinite values since there might be no such transformation possible.

This problem can be solved through various programming languages like Python, Java etc. Here we use Python language because it provides simple syntax which makes solving this problem easier. In this program, we simply check whether the input string contains @ sign or not. If yes then consider it as an email otherwise consider it as a phone number. For both cases we split the string based on @/ and take the part before @ and after @ convert them into lowercase letters and replace middle parts according to their lengths appending @ at the end. Similarly, for phone numbers just remove the parenthesis, hyphen and plus signs and keep the rest of the number while replacing each digit with ***. We also add +/- before the last 10 digits when necessary. This approach will work fine for any type of strings passed as inputs.

Please note this problem could be solved using dynamic programming or sliding window technique but since it requires understanding and implementation of combinatorics concepts which might seem complex initially, I have used brute force approach here with O(n^2) time complexity. This will work fine for small inputs but may exceed the limits on large input sizes due to high computational cost. For larger inputs you should use more efficient methods like Dynamic Programming or Sliding Window techniques. But they require additional data structures and also need some optimization steps such as memoization/dynamic programming. Here I provided simple Python based solution only.

In this problem we are using two pointers approach to solve it. Firstly, We push all indexes with smaller values on top of our stack until current value is larger than some element on top of stack. Then we pop elements from stack till we find out smallest number greater than equal to current one. And then calculate the difference between these numbers as the width of the ramp. This process repeats until we traverse through whole list again. Finally, we will get the maximum width of any valid ramp. In case when the input list does not have any valid ramp, function returns zero.

This Python function creates a dynamic programming (DP) table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways we could end up at index `j` after exactly `i` steps. The DP process involves checking all potential moves from the previous step and updating our DP state accordingly. We use modular arithmetic to avoid overflowing the integer type data in Python. In this problem, since we need to find out how many ways the pointer ends up at index 0 after 'steps' steps, we choose the last column as the target location which has its value equal to zero. This way, we only care about how many ways ending at index 0. If we don't take action on the final column, then the remaining possibilities would be either on other columns or on itself, so they won't affect our result. For every valid move, we add both moving left and staying put into our total count. Also, because we want to calculate the number of ways while taking modulus with `pow(10,9) + 7`, thus using mod operation at each step will ensure that our result fits within the limit.

This function counts how many times there are differing pairs of corresponding elements in both halves of the string. It then returns the smaller of these two quantities - this represents the minimal amount of changes required to transform the string into an alternating pattern. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

            right >>= 1
            left >>= 1
        return left << shift
```
This function works by shifting both `left` and `right` until they become equal. The number of shifts can be calculated using log base 2 operation on `right`. Then we move these shifts back into place by multiplying with `shift + 1` because each time we do a right-shift operation, the value gets halved. This effectively gives us the minimum possible result when considering only the bits that are common between the original values. For example, if `left=9` and `right=7`, after one iteration it will find out that `left = midpoint i.e., 4` but then it multiplies it with `shift+1` resulting in `return left << 1 = 4 * 2 = 8` not `4 * 1 = 4` as required in problem statement. Thus correct answer should be `4 * 2 = 8` instead of `4 * 1 = 4`. Itâ€™s important to note that due to the nature of integer division, any non-power of 2 would cause an overflow issue at some point, so this approach handles those cases correctly.

This Python function uses depth first search to explore all possible combinations of garden colors starting from garden number 1. For every visited garden, we assign its unused color from among four types of flowers to this garden and remove this color from the used sets. We continue this process until there are no more gardens left to visit. Finally, our results will be returned. This approach ensures that for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

In this solution, firstly I build up my adjacency list representation of the tree using dictionary and default value as empty list. Then I traverse through each node by calling depth-first search (dfs). For every node, calculate the xor result of current node's children and add them into 'total_val'. If the calculated xor result larger than previous answer, update the answer. Finally after finishing visiting all nodes, return the highest answer which represent the largest score achievable.

This problem involves dynamic programming and optimization techniques which makes this problem quite tricky. However, its main challenge lies on understanding how to use dynamic programming to solve such problems efficiently. We need to keep track of the maximum possible value at each step while updating our decision based on whether or not we include an item in our knapsack. In terms of time complexity, since we have a loop inside another loop (hence nested loops), this approach has O(nW) time complexity, where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of the bag. This solution passes all test cases successfully but might fail when there are multiple correct answers due to floating point precision error. To handle these situations you may want to consider using decimal instead of floats as follows:

```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
getcontext().prec = 7
Decimal('1.000000')
```
Please note that this would require some changes to your existing implementation because Python
ref:
def maxValue(items, capacity):
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] / x[1], reverse=True)

    maxTotalPrice = 0
    for item in items:
        if capacity >= item[1]:
            capacity -= item[1]
            maxTotalPrice += item[0]
        else:
            maxTotalPrice += item[0] * capacity / item[1]
            break

In above Python Code snippet we first create adjacency list based on input provided. Then define recursive depth first search algorithm to traverse through entire tree structure while maintaining counts of occurrences of each label present at each node. Finally assign these counts back to respective nodes during postorder traversal by updating result array. We start our process from root node here initially. This way we can get correct output even when there are multiple valid answers. Please note that it will work correctly if you use standard counter object instead of dictionary because dictionary does not allow duplicate keys whereas counter allows duplicates. But please keep your mind that counting should be done according to original order of appearance due to some languages/frameworks/libraries may give wrong results otherwise. In case of using Counter() then yes, else no.

The above function calculates two arrays "left" and "right". For each index 'i', it finds out how many numbers to its left that are less than or equal to 'arr[i]' and how many numbers to its right that are greater than 'arr[i]'. It then returns the product of these values plus one more because we can include the number itself in our calculation but exclude other numbers from both sides which will make the total count decrease by one when including the number at current position. Finally, it mods the result according to the provided constraints so as to keep the answer within limit. 
It uses Stack data structure to solve this problem efficiently. Time Complexity O(N).

This problem can be solved by using Union Find algorithm. We first initialize our parent array which will hold the root of each node. Then we implement two helper functions 'find' and 'union'. The 'find' function returns the root of any node while 'union' merges two nodes into a single group. After initializing these data structures, we iterate over every restriction and check whether current person is allowed to be friends based on their previous status. In case they are not, then merge them together. At last, we store boolean values representing results.

This problem seems like an optimization problem which involves dynamic programming and binary search techniques. The main idea here is to find out how many ways we can take 'k' books with k<=i such that it will make minimum difference between two consecutive elements of prefix sum as close as possible. We use this approach by maintaining a table dp[] where dp[i] represents the maximum number of books we can get using at most i books. Then, for every new book added, we try all previous books before adding the current one and update our result accordingly. Finally, after checking all books, return dp[N]. Note that we need to add some conditions inside binarySearch() function to ensure it returns correct answer even when there exists duplicate values in input data. This issue was solved through careful consideration about edge cases.

The function works by iterating over each character in the input string `s`. If the current character matches the last added element in the stack, then we remove that element because they share an common prefix or suffix. Otherwise, we add the new character to the stack. Finally, we return the size of the stack which represents the minimum length after removing non-intersecting substrings. This approach ensures that no substring overlaps with itself due to removal of previous elements.

The above Python function recursively trims down the Binary Search Tree by checking whether the values are within the specified range or not. For every visited node, it checks whether the value lies within the provided range or not. If yes, it returns this child otherwise it discards both left and right subtrees which do not fall within the defined range hence effectively removes these from the final result. This way, only those nodes falling within the desired range remains while other parts get ignored. In case the entire tree has been traversed without finding anything within the limit, an empty tree is returned. Hence ensuring correctness even when input trees might be very large but never exceeding the bound limits.

The above Python code defines a custom data structure named `MyHashSet` that can efficiently handle duplicate values by storing them within multiple buckets of an underlying array. It uses separate chaining as a method to resolve collisions when insertions/deletions occur on different keys with similar hashes but distinct positions in the same bucket. The `__init__()` function initializes the instance variables, while `add(), remove(), and contains()` methods perform respective operations on the internal storage.

This Python function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It creates a matrix 'dp' where each cell contains the total ASCII sum up until that position in the input strings. For every character in the first string, it computes its ASCII sum with all characters in second string. If they match, it takes the ASCII sum till previous positions in both strings; otherwise, it takes the maximum ASCII sum between deletion of current character in first string and deleting current character in second string. The final result will be at the bottom right corner of the matrix ('dp').

This Python script defines a function named `solve()` that takes as input a 2D list representing the current game board, where each element represents either an 'O' character (representing water), a 'X' character (which needs to be flipped), or zero (free space). The function returns the minimum number of moves needed to transform the given board into the desired final configuration, or `-1` if it's impossible.

Then, using a loop, we calculate the XOR operation between each pair of adjacent numbers in the list. At last, we return the resultant XOR value. The time complexity of the above approach is O(n).

This problem requires understanding how to use Python's built-in data structures like Counter, List etc., as well as using these data structures efficiently. The key idea here is keeping track of the frequency of different types of characters in the input string and then trying to find substrings which have equal frequencies by sliding window approach. This solution works because we always want to keep at least half of strings of every type to balance them out. Hence when we encounter such cases, we move our left pointer one step towards right until we get more than half of strings from current character set. And also remember updating answer variable whenever you found the smallest substring having exactly half number of distinct elements. It will take O(N) time complexity due to two nested loops hence overall it would work within constraints provided in LeetCode.

The idea here is to use bit manipulation to generate uniformly distributed indices from zero to total cells in O(logN) time which reduces the overall runtime significantly when dealing with large inputs. The flip operation uses the built-in Python's random module to achieve uniform distribution by generating two independent random numbers between [0, total). Then we calculate the corresponding index based on these two generated integers using bitwise shift and mask operations. If that cell hasn't been flipped yet then we increment our count of non-zero cells and return the coordinates otherwise continue until finding another unflipped cell. In reset method, simply resetting the counts of non-zero cells back to zero. This way, whenever any flip operation happens again, there might be some other already flipped cell available hence satisfying the requirement of having equal probability to get any cell.

This is quite efficient considering the constraints of the problem. Note also that Python lists (and arrays/lists used herein) start at index 0; hence when returning the result by using '%', we get the index corresponding to the remainder value which can be considered as the answer to the problem.

Please replace "pass" with your actual logic. This function should implement a DFS algorithm to check whether each sub-array present in 'sequences' forms a continuous chain starting at index zero (from left to right). If any such chain isn't found then return False else continue checking other chains until you find one which doesnâ€™t form any more continuous chains i.e., this will be our answer. In case when all sequences have been checked and none returned True, return False indicating the input list does not represent a shortest supersequence otherwise return True indicating its representation represents the shortest supersequence.

In this Python solution, firstly I traverse reversed string to find out the last character which is ODD. Then I check all previous elements because when we reach zero index there will be no more element available to compare. After finding such position, I start returning remaining part as result since these would be maximum values. If none exist starting from beginning, I simply return an empty string.

This problem can be solved using simple iteration over each bracket and calculation according to its percentage up to the minimum between remaining income and current upper boundary. If there's still some left after calculating all branches, it should add this part directly into result since we donâ€™t need any further taxing based on these branches. This way makes sure every branch gets fully covered without going beyond their respective boundaries.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list 'nums'. This can be optimized by using a hash map (also known as dictionary or dict). The key would be the current running sum, and its value would be the frequency of that sum up until now. We iterate over each element in the list, update the cumulative sum, then check whether we have seen the cumulative sum minus 'k' before. If yes, it means there are two sums equal to 'k', so increment our counter. Finally, after going through all the possible pairs of starting and ending indices, we return the count which represents the total number of subarrays with sum equals to 'k'.

In the above Python code, we first created a set containing all the childrenâ€™s values of the entire tree. Then, after having identified the roots which have no corresponding parent in our initial list, we simply return that root. This approach runs in O(n) time since we only iterate over the elements once but uses O(m) extra space where m represents the maximum depth of recursive calls on the stack at any point during execution due to the usage of sets. It follows follow up constraints - finding root without using additional storage i.e., constant space complexity with linear time complexity.

The above python function will solve this problem using backtracking approach where every time we select a number at index 'i' and append that number to all the previous permutations which are obtained by generating those permutations whose first digit is not equal to the selected number. We continue this process until there are no more numbers left. At last, we get all the combinations. The complexity of this algorithm is O(n * n!) where n is the size of the input list. This could be quite slow for large inputs due to its high computational complexity. However, since we need to generate all permutations anyway (and thus cannot avoid generating them), this method should work fine even for larger inputs.

This Python function checks whether you can form a jumbo burger with given tomatoes and cheese slices by checking if subtracting cheese slices from total tomato slices results in zero or less than total tomato slices. Similarly, it also ensures that when both tommatoes and cheeses add up to zero, this indicates an impossible combination where neither could exist since at least one must have been used beforehand. Then finally returns the count of jumbo and small burgers required. Otherwise, it returns empty list. It's a simple mathematical approach to solve the problem but provides clear steps on how to apply them.

This Python function takes as input two strings `s` and `t`. It first initializes a list called 'count' which holds the counts of appearances of each letter in both strings. Then it iterates through every character in `s` incrementing its corresponding counter in `count`. Afterwards, it subtracts all values in `count` from `t`, because these will eventually become zeros if combined together. Finally, it returns the sum divided by 2, as each absolute value represents twice the amount of times a particular letter appears. This accounts for the fact that once a letter is added into `s` or `t`, it becomes paired with another letter, thus halving the overall difference between their frequencies.

This problem can be solved by using two nested loops to traverse through the entire grid and then counting the occurrences of '1' from both dimensions. The time complexity will be O(m * n) where m represents the number of rows and n represents the number of columns.

```
This Python function solves the problem using prefix sums approach which provides O(N) time complexity and constant space complexity. It calculates how many moves were required to place all balls into their respective positions initially according to the input string. Then it uses these calculations to calculate the results based on whether there was a '1' before or after each box. This gives us the minimum number of steps necessary to sort the initial arrangement of the balls.

In this function, we start from every unvisited cell having value '1'. For each such cell, we perform Depth First Search (DFS) to visit all its connected cells which have values '1', and update our result list accordingly. The time complexity here would be O(M * N). We use DFS approach because it allows us to go through all reachable nodes within the graph quickly due to the nature of depth-first search algorithm. Also, since we need to record the smallest rectangle covering all farmlands, so we just compare lengths while updating results.

This Python function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned based on the input list of questions. It initializes a list 'dp' with size equal to the length of the input list with all elements set to zero except for the last element which is initialized as the first question's point value. Then it iterates over the list of questions from right to left using a loop starting at index 'i'. In this iteration, it calculates two possible outcomes: either we decide not to solve the current question ('dp[i+1]') or we solve it ('dp[i+questions[i][1]+1] + questions[i][0]'). We choose the larger one between these two possibilities as our answer for the current question ('dp[i]'), and assign it back to 'dp[i]'. Finally, after going through all the questions, it returns the maximum point value achieved during the examination.

This problem requires knowledge about data structures like Disjoint Sets and algorithms like Union-Find. It's also important to note that Python lists should be imported at the top of your file from typing import List. This allows us to use 'List[]', meaning any type of list passed into this method will contain elements of those types.

The above Python function works by iterating over the input list from second index till end where each time it checks whether its value is less than or equal to next value present at same position.

This problem requires understanding about depth-first search algorithm and Python list data structure. It's required to write down recursive function that uses DFS approach to find all possible pairs which sums equals to target value. After finding those pairs, we need to check whether these pairs exist in both BSTs or not. If they do, then it means our requirement can be satisfied otherwise not. This will help us understand how to use Python lists as stacks.

This function works by counting the frequencies of each character in the input string ('s'), then calculating the minimal amount of steps needed to create a sequence with at most half of the characters being 'b'. It makes sure not to over-remove any characters before forming a valid Palindrome because doing so would increase the overall cost significantly. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This implementation assumes that lowercase English alphabets only, and no special symbols or uppercase letters. Adjustments may be necessary based on actual requirements.

The above code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently and compactly by first building a prefix sum array (or histogram). Then it calculates each possible width of the rectangle and adds its area times the total numbers to be counted into result which finally returns as output. The time complexity is O(n^3) where 'n' is the maximum dimension value given in constraints. This could be optimized further but due to the nature of the problem, this approach works fine.

        distance_to_target = len(nums) - start

```
The above function calculates the minimum distance between the given number (either at 'start' or end of list) and the target number by comparing with both possibilities i.e., from left side ('start') or right side ('len(nums) - start - 1'). The result will be either 'start', length of list minus 'start' minus one or length of list minus 'start'-one'. It returns this as output because it can't be calculated otherwise. This would give wrong results when there are multiple occurrences of the same number in the list. For example, if we have a list [1,2,3,4,1], target=1 and start=2 then our function should calculate "from left" as 2 but since there are several numbers equals to 1 in front of position 2, it should calculate it as length of list minus 'start' minus one instead of starting from 'start'. Hence returning min(distance_to_target, start, len(nums) - start - 1).

Note: This problem requires knowledge about Python programming language syntax and data structures like lists (Pythonâ€™s equivalent of arrays), slicing, built-in functions etc. Please make sure you understand these concepts before attempting this problem on your own. The time complexity of this approach is O(N log N). Where N is the size of the input list. In worst case scenario when we need all elements, it needs at least one pass through the sorted list which makes our algorithm as efficient as possible. However, considering additional constraints like upper limit values will increase the space complexity but doesn't affect the overall time complexity. Thus, it remains optimal.

This Python function uses depth first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the entire binary tree. When it finds a node whose value is larger than the current smallest value, it checks whether that node also contains values greater than the smallest value. If yes, it adds these new nodes into the stack; otherwise, it returns the current smallest value as the result. It repeats this process until the end of the tree. In case there are no more nodes which have values greater than the smallest value after DFS finishes, it means we haven't found any second minimum value so it returns -1.

This algorithm works by using a variable to keep track of the current candidate (majority element). It starts with the first number in the list as the candidate. For each other number in the list, it checks whether this number is equal to the current candidate. If they are not equal, then it reduces the count by one; otherwise, it increases it by one. When the count hits zero, it sets the new candidate as the next number from the list. At the end of the loop, the last candidate will be the majority element because we have counted its occurrences enough.

In this Python solution, I use Union Find algorithm to manage relationships among variables based on equality relations. For each variable pair (x, y), create a relationship between them by setting up parent pointer with value (y, coefficient). If any inequality relation occurs, which means some portion of these two groups are not connected yet, then it can cause contradiction so return False immediately. At last, after examining every single group connection, whether it's still able to establish any connections at end, return True. It would be more efficient when dealing with large amount of data.

This Python function works as follows: it maintains a sliding window with no more than two unique characters and keeps track of the maximum size that such window can get until the end of the string. When there are more than two unique characters in the window, it moves the left-most character out of the window (moving the left pointer), so the new window will contain less than or equal to two unique characters. It updates the maximum length whenever possible.

This Python function uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse through the tree from the root to all its descendants. For every visited node, it stores information about its parent and depth into a dictionary named 'parent'. Then, by looking up the parent of both nodes `x` and `y`, we can determine whether these two nodes belong to different cousins or not based on their depths and their relationship with their parents. If there's no common parent between them then they must be either siblings or one of them being outside the tree, which contradicts our assumption that neither should be the other.

This problem involves understanding how to use recursion and backtracking (i.e., using stacks). It also requires knowledge about Python lists and sets data structures. This function will take an expression written with curly brackets { } and convert it into a list of unique strings which can be used later on. These expressions may contain multiple comma separated items within each set surrounded by curly brackets {} and space separating them. They must have distinct elements. Here we need to implement recursive parsing algorithm where we keep track of current parts and separate them according to comma symbol. We pop out last element from our part list every time when encountering a comma and append new element after comma. When closing parenthesis comes, we perform expansion operation i.e., repeat previous process until finding starting bracket again. After finishing processing all parts, sort your final results.

```
In this Python program, I used list comprehension to generate a list of target indexes where it's safe to catch someone. Then I calculated the maximum number of times you can catch some people within these targets using another list comprehension. This approach ensures that each catch operation does not miss out on any potential catches due to overlaps between operations. It also takes care of the edge case when there is no other valid target left after checking the current one. The time complexity is O(n).

The above code first checks whether both string have same size. Then it counts frequency of characters from both strings using two arrays 'countS1' and 'countS2'. After that it iterates over all indices where character frequencies match with original string's frequencies. In case when there are more than 26 matching pairs we return True otherwise False. For every new index we decrease current char's freq in 'countS2' array and increase its corresponding entry in 'countS1', after this operation we again perform matching to find any matched pair.

In this Python function, we take advantage of the property that differentiate between two identical arrays will yield a unique string which can only occur when their corresponding elements differ on exactly one position due to its binary nature. The idea here is to use bitwise operations such as OR (|), AND (&), NOT (~). We create our answer using these operations, but since we want to avoid leading zeros, we need to shift right until we reach enough space for our resulting string. Finally, we convert it back into binary format and return it. This approach ensures that no single digit differs more than once in any binary form.

In this problem, I first converted all numbers to negatives since Python uses min-heap by default which gives us maximum value at top i.e., smallest elements when iterated over again. Then using heap operations 'push', 'pop' and 'heapify' performed as per requirement. Finally returned sum of remaining piles.

This problem can be solved by using two stacks (one regular one and one auxiliary one). The main idea is maintaining an extra stack where we store all the possible maximum values seen so far during pushing operation. During 'pop', we first check whether the current value at the top of our normal stack matches the maximum value in our auxillary stack. If they match, then we find out how many times this maximum has appeared in our normal stack before being removed as well. We do this by iterating through the list backward since appending elements into an empty list takes constant time O(1), whereas getting items from a nonempty list needs linear time O(n). After we have found such occurrence, we continue popping until we get back to its original position in the normal stack. This way we are able to achieve logarithmic time complexity for both 'top' and 'popMax'.

In this problem, you need to find out how many times that itâ€™s possible to partition a list so that every part is sorted in ascending order. In other words, calculate the total amount of elements before index i that are smaller than arr[i]. Then check whether there exists any element after index j larger than arr[j]. If yes, then increment your counter by one because we found a valid way to divide the original list into several parts where all parts are sorted. At last add one to the final answer since at least one subarray must be divided.

In this problem we use Stack data structure because last element of the stack would be our answer which depends on previous elements based upon operators like AND(&), OR(|), XOR(^). So every time when operator comes at top of stack, we need to perform operation between two values. For example if current character is '&', first value must be ANDed with next one, so popped out all items till '&'. And same applies for other cases too. This approach ensures correct evaluation order of operations.

This problem requires understanding of datetime manipulation which is quite complex but it's possible with Python's built-in modules like 'datetime'. It involves working on different units like seconds, minutes, hours, days, months or years. This problem also helps in learning about dictionary data structure and its use while dealing with keys of dictionaries. The concept used here is called Time Interval Based Filtering.

In this Python script, we define an object named 'Solution'. Then we create a function called 'insertionSortList', which takes a parameter 'head'. This parameter represents the head node of our singly linked list. Inside the function, we first check whether the head node exists and whether its next node also exists. If these conditions are met, then we proceed to the main part of the function where we use pointers to traverse through the list. We keep track of previous and current nodes by initializing them as 'prev' and 'curr' respectively. In each loop, we compare the values of the current node and the previous node. If they are out of order, we move the previous pointer towards the beginning of the unsorted portion of the list, adjusting the next pointers accordingly. After all nodes have been processed, we return the new head of the sorted list. Note that we need to initialize a pseudoHead node before starting because when the original head node has already been moved to be smaller than any other value, we cannot just simply change the next pointer of the pseudoHead node directly. Instead, we need to connect the pseudoHead node back together again so that we can get the correct result after sorting. Finally, we call the function on the given LinkedList and print out the results.

    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):

The above solution works by counting the amount of 'L's and 'R's encountered so far in the string. If we encounter a 'L', we increase our count; if we encounter a 'R', we decrease our count. At every point where our count equals zero (indicating all 'L's or all 'R's), we increment our result counter. This will give us the maximum number of balanced strings possible from the given input string.

This problem can be solved by using Depth First Search algorithm but since there are two conditions here - checking whether the substring before the last character is same as after reversed version of the remaining string which cannot form palindrome or after splitting at some point it should be equal to original string, so I used above approach where each time I am trying to split from index 'i', I firstly make sure my previous substrings formed a valid Palindrome, if yes then proceed else skip onwards. The condition checks both cases. For example, if you see "aba", then it must be a valid palindrome because you need to ensure its reverse ("a") is also a valid palindrome i.e., it does not create new palindromes like "a"+"ba". Hence these conditions are added within the loop. This makes use of the fact that a string is a palindrome if and only if the characters 37%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‹      | 11/30 [00:54<01:35,  5.00s/it]

This problem can be solved using Depth First Search (DFS), we need to keep track of all nodes that have been processed through the recursive calls until reaching the base case when no more nodes remain. When we find an invalid node which has already been processed by some other node then we simply skip this process since we don't want to change any structure. We also make sure our path always goes left because removing children means going up towards the top level, hence we should go down first to avoid changing the position of the remaining valid nodes.

This problem requires knowledge about graph theory and dynamic programming concepts. It's important to note that this implementation assumes that each pair of distinct vertices has at least one common ancestor in the tree structure. If all pairs have multiple common ancestors, then no information can be retrieved about distances or paths without additional data structures. Also, please consider that we use depth-first search here as it provides an efficient way to calculate the shortest path between two points. In real problems, it might need more sophisticated algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or A* algorithm depending upon specific requirements.

This Python function uses dynamic programming to calculate how many valid subarrays there are with exactly 'k' numbers divisible by 'p'. The main idea behind solving this problem efficiently is to use cumulative sum modulo 'p', since we need to find out the number of different subarrays having exactly 'k' numbers divided evenly among themselves. We first compute the cumulative sums modulo 'p' and then do a simple calculation based on the cumulative counts. In terms of space complexity, we store three dimensions of size (n+1), so the overall space complexity would be O(np).

This problem asks us to find all possible ways to divide a list into two parts where sum of every part is at least 'k'. To solve this we need to use dynamic programming which involves checking all possibilities whether they satisfy our conditions or not. It's very similar to the classic partition problem but with added constraints on the input data. This time, we want to ensure there are only certain numbers between these two sums so we have additional checks while generating the DP table.

This Python program uses a stack data structure to solve this problem. We iterate over each character in the input string. If the current character is a star ('*'), then we pop the last element from our stack (which should be the non-star character). Otherwise, we push the character onto the stack. Finally, we join all elements in the stack into a single string and return it. This effectively removes all instances of remaining characters until there are none left.

This Python function takes an input string as parameter and calculates the maximum length of palindromes you can form from this string by taking advantage of all possible characters present in the string. It uses a list called 'count' to keep track of each letter's frequency. Then it iterate through the list counting how many pairs of identical characters exist and adding half these counts to our result ('total'). This way, no matter what characters are used at least once, they can form a valid palindrome. At the end, we need to check whether the final value of 'total' is even because any remaining single-character strings would still fit into a palindrome. In such case, we just increment 'total'. Finally, we return 'total', which represents the required answer.

In this solution, I am using an approach where by going to the right side of the parent (i.e., the next larger element). But when there exists multiple such elements then you need to traverse up until you find the first ancestor which doesnâ€™t have the same direction as its children i.e., it would be our in order predecessor.
This function returns the last accessed node before returning from looping through all ancestors. This ensures we get the largest possible node smaller than 'p'.

In this problem, we just need to find out how many operations (increments) would be needed to convert each element into its smallest possible value such that no two elements become equal. The reason being, if there were multiple numbers having same least value then they should increase together as much as possible which means atleast one operation will increase more than others because some other increments might not happen. Hence, moving any single digit further towards left increases the count but does not affect whether other digits still remain equal or not since increasing them doesn't change their positions anymore. So using "sum" function gives us total number of operations required while subtracting minimum from it gives us difference between maximum and minimum value remaining after performing above steps. This difference represents the operations required to bring down all these discrepancies/differences to zero thus giving us our final result.

In this Python program we first define an instance of our solution class. The method 'sortTransformedArray' takes four arguments which are the input list (nums), two coefficients (a and b). It returns the transformed array as per the problem statement. In the main logic inside the method, it uses a double pointer approach to traverse through the given list from both ends until they meet at the middle point. Depending on whether a or b is positive or negative, it assigns either the maximum or minimum value from its corresponding side to the current position in the output array. Finally, it makes sure that all elements have been processed by checking their sides against one another. This ensures that no duplicates will be added to the final answer. If a is greater than zero then leftmost values get picked otherwise right most

This function works by repeatedly rotating the string left by one position (which means taking the substring starting at index i+1 till end then adding the start of the string upto that index), comparing them lexicographically. It keeps track of the minimum rotation string found so far. At the end of every rotation, it checks whether it's lexicographically smaller than the previous rotations seen thus far. This ensures that even though there could be multiple correct answers due to rotational nature of problem, we always get the minimal possible string when asked to find out.

```  
This Python function uses a simple iterative approach to solve the problem. We sort both the current word and previous word (which stores the last processed word). If they're not equal, then it means these two words are not anagrams of each other, hence append them into the result list; otherwise, skip them. Finally, update the value of 'prev_word'. At the end, return the result list which contains only non-anagramic words. This method works because when two words are anagrams, their sorted versions should be identical regardless of their actual content. Hence, comparing their sorted versions gives us whether they are anagrams or not.

    i = 1

The above Python program uses builtin functions like map(), filter() etc., which are quite efficient compared to manual looping through each element. It also makes good use of Python's powerful features including list comprehension, lambda expressions and higher order functions like reduce(). The complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn), where n is the length of input list. This approach works well because we have to consider every single digit at least once when comparing two digits.

This function works by first checking whether the current node is null or not. If yes then just return null as there is nothing left to do. Now based on the comparison between keys and values at each step check which branch needs to follow according to the rule mentioned in problem statement. After deleting the leaf node case, after recursive call replace the deleted node data with minimum from right subtree. For non leaf cases where more than one child exist, keep replacing parentâ€™s value with smallest element present in right subtree till its leftmost child becomes null. This way correct position of elements gets maintained during deletions. Finally return modified root node.

This function uses dynamic programming to find out minimum skips needed. We initialize a list 'dp' with maximum values such that we always end up having nonnegative distance left over from previous steps. Then, for each step from beginning till end, we update our current state by taking either the maximum possible distance so far plus remaining distance divided by speed (or zero if no negative possibility exists) or just moving ahead without considering any additional skips. Finally, we check whether there is any valid answer within the constraints and return it. If none exist, then -1 is returned. This approach ensures optimal performance since we only consider lower bounds for potential results.

This problem can also be solved by using bit manipulation and XOR operation which makes it more efficient than other methods but this method requires understanding of binary operations.
Please note that Python's built-in integer division (//) does floor division when used with two integers. So 'right //= 2' means "divide right by 2" and discards any remainder. Similarly 'right -= 1' means subtract 1 from right. And 'direct ^=1' is equivalent to 'direct = not direct'. This way, we keep track of our progress through the list and use these values to decide how many elements we should remove each time.

This problem can be solved using Python dictionary to store each sender's word count and then find out which sender has the maximum word count among all. This approach works because it keeps track of the word count separately for each sender, so it avoids redundant computation when multiple solutions exist. It also uses built-in functions like split(), sorted() etc., provided by Python standard library which makes it easier to solve this problem.

```
The time complexity is O(n), as we go through all elements once. The space complexity is O(1), because we use a constant amount of extra space (variables). This makes our algorithm very efficient. We do not need to keep track of multiple variables throughout the program, hence making our memory usage manageable.

The function works by maintaining a list called `stack` which will keep track of opening brackets encountered so far. For each closing bracket we encounter, we pop from our stack because this means we have closed some open brackets. The maximum length of such opened substring at any point will give us the answer. At end, `len(stack)` gives the number of unbalanced parenthesis i.e., how many levels deep we were when all parantheses were balanced. Thus, returning the maximum value among these two cases.

In this problem we first create an adjacency list which will help us keep track of all the connections between different nodes. Then we calculate the total number of times each node appears with any other node. Finally, we check every combination of nodes against our desired condition and add up those pairs that meet it. This approach ensures that we only look at valid combinations once when counting them, thus improving performance significantly.

In this function we first use DFS to find out all depths and corresponding parent mappings between two subtrees at different levels of the tree. Then using another DFS starting from the roots found above, we find out the least common ancestors among these leaf nodes where they share their farthest left or right child on both sides. Finally, we return the root of those leaf nodes whose depth is equal to the highest depth. Note that this approach requires O(N^2) time complexity due to the usage of sets and lists inside loops. There might exist more efficient solutions based on properties of trees like Binary Indexed Trees etc., but this implementation suits the problem constraints well.

class Solution:
    def medianSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[float]:
```
The above problem statement does not specify what should happen when k is greater than or equal to the length of the input array. Hence I have added an exception handling mechanism that returns empty list when such scenario occurs. Here is my implementation using this approach:

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def medianSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[float]:
        if len(nums) < k: return []
        window_medians = []
        slist = SortedList()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            slist.add(nums[i])
            if len(slist) > k:
                slist.remove(nums[i-k])
            if len(slist) == k:
                med = (slist[k//2] + slist[k//2-k%2])/2
                window_medians.append(med)
                
        while True:
            try:
                next(window_medians)
            except StopIteration:
                break
            
        return window_medians
```
In this code, we use a SortedList data structure with Python's builtin sorting function. This allows us to keep track of the elements in our current 'sliding' window. When adding new elements, it automatically sorts them into correct order. We also remove outdated elements once we exceed the defined window size. After calculating the median, we add it to the resultant list, then continue until all windows have been processed.

ref:
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def medianSlidingWindow(nums, k):
    window = SortedList(nums[:k])
    medians = []
    
    for i in range(k, len(nums) + 1):
        medians.append((window[k // 2 - 1] + window[k // 2]) / 2 if k % 2 == 0 else float(window[k // 2]))
        
        if i < len(nums):
            window.remove(nums[i - k])
            window.add(nums[i])

    return medians

```
This Python function calculates the required result using the provided constraints. The first step involves counting the number of words and spaces in the input text. Then it checks whether distributing them equally is possible or not. Finally, based on the conditions, it constructs the output string accordingly.

This problem can be solved by using prefix sums approach which involves counting how many times each index appears before it. We iterate over this list to find all possible pairs that add up to our desired sum. This will give us the required result. But please note that we have added extra checks such as "if left > 0" because when we move from one side of the window to another, we need to consider whether there're elements on both sides that could make up the target sum. So, after finding out any pair whose sum equals to 'goal', we try to include those numbers at beginning also into results.

This problem can also be solved with more efficient algorithms such as Binary Indexed Tree/Fenwick Trees but this approach might require some understanding about data structures like Fenwick trees which are useful when we need to update elements in an ordered sequence very efficiently. Also note that it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean there should be no bit manipulation operations within our algorithm because they could potentially make part of the answer incorrect due to floating point precision issues.

This Python function uses the concept of "Counting Sort" algorithm which works based on frequency distribution or histogram. We start from the maximum value in 'costs' list and keep reducing 'coins'. If we run out of 'coins', then it means that our current iteration does not contribute anything to the result so we stop here. Otherwise, we reduce the remaining amount and increment its index counter till we reach zero. This process continues until we have consumed every coin available. Finally, we return the counter minus one because last time when loop was stopped, we did not consider this case but now we considered each item once again due to while condition checking after subtraction operation. So decremented the final answer by one.

```
Please note that this problem requires knowledge about arrays and loops, as well as understanding how to calculate the cost based on the input data provided. It's also important to understand what happens during each iteration of the loop. In Python, we often use enumeration (enumerate()) function to iterate over lists or any sequence type like string etc., it returns both index and value from the list/sequence simultaneously. For instance, 'num in enumerate(customers)' would give us tuple containing index ('i') and actual element from our custom list ('num'). Here 'i' represents the position of the item in our sequence and 'num' gives us the item itself. We increment 'current_rotations' by 'boardingCost' everytime we move to next round and decrease 'res_rotations' by one because we do not serve anyone yet but still keep track of rotations done till now. Then we subtract the served person count from 'current_rotations'. After completion of full cycle, we check whether we could get negative total cost or not, if yes then immediately returning '-1', otherwise continuing with remaining steps. At last, returning resultant number of rotations required.

```
The first function 'dfs' calculates the total number of nodes reachable from this node by DFS traversal. Then we calculate the result value as (total_nodes - subtree_count), because each node needs to be counted only once while counting its sub-trees.

The second function 'dfs2' updates the distance value based on the calculation done at step 1. It starts calculating from the leaf nodes towards root nodes again due to the nature of BFS or similar depth-first search algorithm. Note that after visiting child nodes, it subtracts their counts from the current nodeâ€™s accumulated results and adds back the size of these children into the overall count. This gives us correct values for remaining non-leaf nodes which were already calculated before during initial DFS pass.

In this Python program, we use depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to solve this problem. The basic idea is to keep track of each character and its corresponding state in our Trie. If we encounter a dot ('.'), then we check all possible next characters recursively; if we encounter an alphabetical character, then we move directly into the children of current node. When searching, we also need to handle edge cases such as when we reach the end of the input word but still have some characters left in the middle part of it. We should only return true once we finish traversing all characters in the input word.

This function takes list of strings 'folder' which contains names of directories. It sorts this list based on directory name lengths followed by dictionary order. Then it iterates over these sorted lists. In every iteration, it checks whether current folder starts with previous folder prefix. If yes, means we found another instance of the same folder under some other prefix, hence skip this one otherwise add it into result list. At last update the current string for next comparison. Finally return the answer list i.e., remaining folders after removal of duplicated ones.

This Python program defines a function called "isBalanced" that checks whether or not a given binary tree is height balanced. It uses recursion to traverse each subtree and calculate its height (maximum depth). If at any point there's a discrepancy between heights of two subtrees, then we know that this tree is not balanced, so we return -1 immediately. Otherwise, after checking all subtrees, we return maximum height plus one as current node's height. This way, our main function only needs to iterate through the tree once.

The above function starts by creating a new dummy node which acts like a pseudo header before actual values come into picture. Then it traverses through each element in the input list one by one. For every visited node, checks whether this sum upto now is already present in our map or not. If yes then we found a subsequence whose sum equals to zero hence deleting those elements using another pointer (temporary).

This Python function uses bit manipulation to generate subsets from given string. It first generates all possible combinations of size 'k', stores them into a set, and checks whether this set contains exactly 2^k members. If so, returns True; otherwise, returns False. This approach takes advantage of the fact that generating subsets using bitwise operations often leads to cleaner and more efficient solutions compared to brute force methods.

In this code, replace all underscores (_) with an empty string ('') then convert them to list format because Python does not support direct manipulation of individual characters as they do in other languages like Java/C++ etc. Then compare each element of starting string with respective element of target string based on their positions. For example, if starting point has L and ending point has R, check if they have same index values otherwise return False. After comparing these conditions apply recursively until you reach middle points of both strings which are now either empties or contains some non-empty characters. Return True when all checks pass successfully. This will solve the problem efficiently.

The function starts by initializing two pointers to represent whether the sequence increases and decreases. Then it iterates over each pair of adjacent elements in the list; if a pair reverses the order (increases becomes decreases, or decreases become increases), then we know that this subsequence cannot be monotonically increasing/decreasing. If none of these conditions are met, we update our counters accordingly. Finally, after checking all pairs, we check if any counter was updated. This will give us information about whether the entire sequence is either strictly increasing or decreasing, which can help determine whether the original sequence could have been monotonically increasing or decreasing before being split into two non-strictly increasing/non-decreasing sequences.

In this Python solution, I am using a pointer (i and j) to iterate through both arrays from right to left. The sum of each corresponding pair of elements from these arrays plus any previous carry value is appended to the result list. If there's still some remaining carry after processing all pairs, it should be appended to the end of the result. Finally, the function removes any extra trailing zeroes from the beginning of the resulting list. Please note that you need to import 'List' from typing module before running your program. This solution assumes input lists are correctly formed according to constraints provided in problem statement.

Then find out the total sum of the remaining part after index 'k' from the original list. For each element before 'k', it calculates the potential maximum score by subtracting the previous prefix sum value plus current number times its position minus twice last added item from the tail, then takes maximum between these two cases. Finally returns result. This way we get the maximum possible score of good subarray based on constraints provided.

```
The above Python function uses two pointers approach to locate the start point and end points of the unsorted subarray within the given list. Then we calculate the smallest and largest numbers between these indices to see if they can form the entire range. We do this by scanning through the elements at both ends until we meet with any out-of-place element on either side. The overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because each element is visited exactly once.

```
This function uses dictionary comprehension to generate a list of counts for each character, then sorts it with a tuple comparison using slicing at the end. The final result is obtained by joining keys from the dictionary into a single string. Note that we use `count[k][:-1] > count[k][-1]` instead of just comparing `count[k]` because when there's a tie between two different letters, Python will sort them lexicographically (alphabetical order). This means that if both the count of first and second places is equal, then the later occurrence gets precedence over earlier occurrence. Hence, `count[k][-1] - count[k][:-1] > 0` ensures that lower case comes before upper case in lexicographical order. We remove last element from count[k] since its boolean value indicates whether higher ranked character should come before lower ranked character. Finally, join these results together into a string.

In this solution, we use Breadth First Search (BFS) strategy which means that at each step we are visiting all nodes on the current level before moving to the next level. We keep track of the current level and add it to our results list until there are no more nodes to process in the current level. Then we move on to the next level and repeat the process until there are no more levels to process. This way, we ensure that every node has been visited according to their depth in the tree.

This problem can be solved by using BFS algorithm with some modifications as described above. The main difference between regular BFS and this one lies on how we handle visiting all possible neighbors when moving to next position. In current implementation, it checks every direction only once but it should check each direction at least once since we have already checked its previous directions. Also note that before adding any coordinates into the queue, we need to mark them as visited i.e., set their value to '1'. This way, even though we visit these coordinates multiple times, we still count them as a single step because they don't move us closer than previously.

It prints nodes in reversed order but does not return any result or modify the original list as per follow-up constraints. This approach has a constant space complexity since it creates no new data structures that grow with the size of the input. It also runs in O(n) time where n is the number of elements in the linked list because we visit every element exactly once. Its memory usage is O(1), meaning its space complexity is constant regardless of the input size. Thus meets both requirements from the follow-ups.

This Python function uses two pointers to iterate through the input string. If the current character equals the previous one, we increment our counter; otherwise, we calculate the length of the substring using the formula n * (n+1) / 2 (where n is the current counter), add this value modulo `MOD`, and reset the counter to 1. After going through the entire string, we repeat the last calculation with the final counter. This approach works because each substring can only start or end at any position by itself so that makes calculating its length very straightforward. It also takes advantage of the fact that the result might be quite big, but it will fit comfortably into a standard integer type variable without causing overflow error when computing the summation. Finally, the function returns the calculated total sum which meets the problem's requirement.

The time complexity is O(N log N), where N is the length of the input string because we sort the characters. The space complexity is O(N) due to storing the sorted list of characters.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming approach to optimize it by reducing time complexity from O(mn^2) to O(mn). Here, we first calculate all possible sums starting from each cell in top left corner till bottom right corner which will give us total sum of every possible submatrix inside our main array. Then, we find out the maximum among these sums. This approach reduces the number of calculations required hence improving the performance significantly.

This Python function takes three arguments: upper, lower, and colsum. It first initializes two lists, upper_part and lower_part, both having the same size as colsum. Then, it iterates over the list colsum using its index. For every cell that has a value of 2, it sets this cell in both upper_part and lower_part and decreases the corresponding counters by 1. Afterwards, it checks if either counter goes below zero; if yes, it returns an empty list because it's not possible to form a matrix with these constraints. Otherwise, it reiterates once more to fill up the rest of the matrix according to the remaining counts of upper and lower parts. Finally, it checks if both counters reach zero after the iteration; if they do, it means that the entire matrix was successfully formed, hence it returns the filled matrices; otherwise, it returns an

This Python script uses 'collections' module which provides alternatives to built-in container data types like list, tuple etc. It also utilizes 'Counter' function provided by 'collections'. This method helps us count the frequency of each element in an iterable object i.e., our case with 'nums', where keys would represent elements present in 'nums' and values would represent their frequencies. Then it starts repeating the process until all unique pairs have been processed. Finally, it returns the length of dictionary created at last i.e., stores the different averages found during processing. If needed, this implementation may need adjustments based on specific requirements or constraints.

In Python, you can use built-in library functions like randrange or choice (from random module). But since we need to implement our own random number generator from scratch, I suggest using these methods if available. If not, then implementing your own would require understanding how randomness works under the hood which may involve complex algorithms that go beyond simple programming tasks.

```
In this Python program, we first calculate the prefix sums of the input list 'nums'. Then we initialize a dynamic programming table 'dp' with dimensions equal to the number of splits ('m') and elements as zeroes. The base case is when there is one element in each split, which means the maximum possible sum is the single element itself. We fill up our dp table by considering all possible splitting points from leftmost end until rightmost end. For every split point 'i', at index 'j', we find the current subarray sum using prefix_sum[] subtraction operation. We then iterate through other indices 'k' less than or equal to 'j' and try out different split points 'i'. Finally, we return the value stored in last cell of our dp table, which represents the minimum maximized sum after applying 'm' splits. This approach has a time complexity O(n^2 * m), space complexity O(n * m).

In this code, we use prefix sum technique to solve this problem efficiently. Firstly, we create a new list "count" where every number at position i represents the amount of numbers between 0 and i in the original array "nums". Then we calculate the accumulated count using the prefix sum method. Afterwards, we sort both lists according to their indices and the values themselves. Finally, we iterate over our sorted count list and add up elements from sorted requests until we reach a smaller value or exceed the length of the sorted requests. For each such case, we update the result accordingly. This way, we maximize the sum among all possible permutations. Note that due to the modulus operation, the final result will always fit within a 32 bit integer limit.

If no node can be reached after visiting all potential nodes, return -1.

In this code, firstly, I used the Counter function from Pythonâ€™s built-in collection library to get the frequencies of all unique characters in the input string. Then, I sorted these frequencies so they are arranged in ascending order. If a character has more than one occurrence, then remove its maximum occurrences until it becomes less than or equal to one. The remaining elements which are greater than one represent those characters whose deletion will cause any duplicate character left after removing their maximum occurence. This is added into result variable as well. At last, the minimum number of deletions required would be returned by the method.

This Python script first converts input number to integer type then calculates each good base starting from largest one down to two until finding the best option. If current base cannot convert to given number directly, increase the base; otherwise decrease the base. At last, returns the found good base. If none could be found, default value '1' will be returned because there're always at least one valid digit that makes up the whole number. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(logN^(1/p)), where N is the length of the input string, p is the precision level. This is achieved through binary search technique which reduces the searching space approximately half every iteration.

This function works by first defining a helper function called "rotate" which rotates a matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise. Then it applies this rotation four times (since we need to rotate it four ways), checking each time whether A matches the target. If no match is found after applying all four rotations, then there's no way to convert A into the target without making more than three full rotations. The algorithm stops when it finds that A equals to the target. This means that once A reaches its target state, it will stop immediately because of the previous check. However, since Python list slicing operation does not modify original lists, we don't have to worry about the last check returning False as long as there exists an element mismatch between A and Target within any round of rotations. Hence, the worst case scenario remains O(N^2). N here represents the size of square matrix i.e., n * n where n = 3. In other words, one cannot directly apply this approach on such large input cases due to high complexity.

In this Python function, we use binary search to find the position of the target value within the matrix. We start by initializing our boundaries as 0 and the length of the total number of elements minus one (since indexing starts from 0). Then, we enter a loop where we calculate the middle element's position and compare it with the target. If they match, then we have found our target so we return True; if the middle element is less than the target, that means our target can only be on the right side of the current range, hence we move our boundary to the right; otherwise, we know our target could only lie in the left half of the current range, hence we move our boundary to the left. This process continues until our bounds meet up which indicates whether our target exists in the matrix.

In above Python Code, we have defined a method named 'combinationSum'. This method takes as parameters - the list of distinct integers (representing the possible values), and the target integer. It returns a list of lists where each sublist contains distinct combinations of these values which adds up to the target. The function uses depth-first search technique to explore all possibilities. If the current pathâ€™s sum equals to target, then add this path into the results. Otherwise, iteratively check every possibility by adding them into the path first. After checking, backtrack and try another choice. For example, when adding [2,2,3], after finding [2,2,3], if there isn't any more way to get the final answer, go back to previous step and choose again, so you could select [2,2,2,2]. When calling DFS on subsequent calls, pass the new start position index "i", not resetting it to zero will ensure duplicate subsets like [2,2,2,2] are allowed because they share the same subset sums.

The above-mentioned algorithm uses a priority queue data structure to keep track of the ending times of each meeting. It also keeps track of how many rooms are currently being used.

This approach ensures optimal utilization of resources as it minimizes the total number of rooms needed.

In this Python program, we first create a dictionary called 'graph' to represent our graph as adjacency list representation. Then, we define helper functions named 'dp' and 'countNodes'. The function 'dp' calculates the minimum number of trees such that maximum distance between any two cities is equal to 'd', while the function 'countNodes' counts how many subtrees contain all vertices except 'x' and 'y' having maximum distance less than or equals to 'd'. Finally, we call these helpers recursively for all possible values of 'd' ranging from 1 to n-1 and append the result into the final answer list.

This function first counts the frequency of each number using a dictionary to store the frequency of numbers as they appear in `arr`. Then, we iterate over this dictionary checking whether any value's frequency exceeds half of total length of list or not. If yes then returns that number which has been found most frequently among all occurrences greater than 'n/4'. This ensures that only single occurrence such element will be returned from the function since other elements are guaranteed to have less frequency due to nature of problem constraints.

This problem can be solved by first calculating the prefix sum array to get the sum of submatrix from any point to any other point within the given matrix. Then it calculates the answer by subtracting the sum at top left corner of smaller rectangle from bottom right corner of larger one and adding back the sum at top left corner of smaller rectangle. This process repeats until every cell in the original matrix has been processed. The time complexity is O(R*C) where R and C are number of rows and columns in input matrix respectively. Space complexity is also O(R*C).

```
In this Python solution, we first compute two lists 'left' and 'right', each list contains minimum distances from either end to the nearest occupied seat. We start by setting all elements equal to infinity except when there is no seat on the respective side. Then we iterate through the input list again, but now considering only those indices which have both sides available seats. For these indices, we take the minimum value among the values found previously in our computed lists. The result will be the maximum value obtained amongst all these minimum values calculated beforehand. This ensures that while moving towards the center of the seating arrangement, we maximize the total space between people.

This problem can be solved by dynamic programming or greedy algorithm with priority queue. In this case, we use DFS and memorization technique. We try every combination until no more combinations left then backtrack and calculate total costs. This method is fast because it doesn't recalculate same subproblem multiple times. But remember the base condition should always come first when using recursion function. Otherwise, it might lead us into infinite loop. And also note that the time complexity of your solution could be high due to the large input size so consider optimization techniques like Binary Search or Sliding Window.

```
This Python solution uses a greedy approach with a priority queue (max heap). It sorts the courses based on their ending times. Then, for each course, we check whether taking this course would exceed our deadline, i.e., the sum of its durations up until then plus its end time is greater than the actual end time of the course. If yes, we discard this course; otherwise, we push its duration into the priority queue. At the end, the size of the priority queue gives us the maximum number of courses we can take. This algorithm ensures to choose the longest running course first when possible. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N log N), where N is the length of the input list.

```
This Python function will take in an input value `n` and check if this value is greater than zero. If so, it checks how many ones are present in the binary representation of `n` using the builtin `bin()` function which returns a string starting with "0b" indicating that it's a binary number. It counts the occurrences of '1' in this binary string by counting the occurrence of '1'. This count should be exactly one because every power of two can be represented as a binary number where all bits except possibly the least significant bit are zeros. Therefore, we need at most one '1' in the binary representation of a power of two. If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns True; otherwise, False. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1), i.e., constant time, since no matter how large `n` gets, the operations performed within the function stay constant regardless of the size of `n`.

This algorithm uses depth-first search to find the most quiet person on any path between two nodes. It maintains a resultant answer array 'res' such that res[i] holds the minimum quietness person amongst those having more money than person i. After building this graph using adjacent lists, we start exploring every person starting from their quietest one till everyone else. If current person is quieter than some other person then update our resultant array accordingly. This way by iterating through each person once we get results regarding whether someone is quieter or not based on previous information.

This function works by recursively choosing the largest element that can be appended to the result at each step until we reach our base case where there's only one digit left. It merges the results obtained from picking larger elements separately into a final result. This way it always picks the "largest" possible number before moving on to smaller ones which ensures that all picked numbers form a valid combination with others. Finally, this algorithm makes sure to keep the order as per original input since after sorting based on current position, any remaining elements will have higher values than them because they come later in sorted list. For example consider [9,8,6,5,3]. If you look at it again, it starts decreasing from rightmost side so it should not start adding new digits from the beginning. So when we take first 'mid', it does not matter whether we choose [9,8,6,5,3] or [8,9,6,5,3], but both give us the output correctly

In this Python solution, we create a list called "res" and initialize all elements as zero. For each booking, we add the amount of seats to or subtract the amount of seats from our result list based on whether it's a 'premium' or 'regular' booking. After adding these changes to our result list, we then calculate prefix sums which gives us the cumulative sum upto any index. Finally, we remove the last element since it does not contribute anything to the final result. The time complexity here is O(N).

This problem can be solved by using prefix sum technique along with simple counting. We first create prefix[] and suffix[] arrays which represent how many numbers from left or right we have more than once. Then calculate overlap count as min value between prefix and suffix values for each pair of ranges. Finally add this overlap count to result and return modulus of total count after calculation. This approach takes O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting but still gives correct output within reasonable time limits.

This problem could be solved with dynamic programming or greedy approach but I think dynamic programming might be more suitable here because we need to consider all possible combinations so it's easier to implement using DP method. We first sort the events based on their ending times. Then we create a 2D dp table where each cell stores the maximum sum we can get when considering certain subset of events. For every event, there are two choices whether to take it or leave it. Either way, the maximum sum would depend on the result obtained after taking/leaving the last chosen event. Hence, we should fill up our dp table iteratively. After filling up the dp table, we just pick the maximum value from the bottom right corner of the table since this is guaranteed to contain the answer to the whole problem. This solution has O(N^2) complexity due to nested loops inside the main loop and uses O(N

This Python function uses collections.Counter objects to keep track of how many times each character appears in each word. It then iterates over the list of target words, checking whether there exists another word with exactly same properties (but different characters). This approach gives us the number of valid conversion pairs between the starting words and target words.

This function works by comparing each bit in the 'target' with its corresponding bit in 's'. If they differ (i.e., it's '1' but we actually don't care about this bit), then we add 1 to our total count of flips. This counts as making sure the current bit matches the next one from 'target', because if we made no such changes yet, there will be some unflipped bits left which would cause them to match with their respective positions later on. The final result is the total count of these differences.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log N), where N is the size of the input list 'nums'. This is because we sort a list that contains N elements (and thus takes linear time). Space complexity is O(N) as we create a new list containing unique values from 1 to n. Here, "unique" means no duplicates within the original list 'nums', so removing any duplicate values will result in approximately half the space used by the initial list. So, the actual space usage would depend on how many distinct numbers there are between 1 and n inclusive. If it's less than or equal to about 1/8th of the memory available then it could fit into memory without needing more. However, since we only use one additional variable per iteration regardless of the length of the list, even with multiple iterations, the space complexity remains roughly proportional to the length of the list. That being said, please note that due to Python's nature of handling large data sets differently compared to languages like C++, the exact constant factor may vary depending on your specific system configuration.

```
The function works by repeatedly dividing the input number by 3 until it cannot be divided anymore i.e., when its value becomes less than 3. At this point, if at any step during division, the remainder would have been greater than 2 which contradicts our original assumption about the values being able to reach till maximum limit in terms of numbers themselves e.g., max=10^3 , so it should only end up as 1 when all remaining steps are done after reducing multiples of 3 from right side. Hence, if n ends up as 1 or 2 or some multiple of 3 before reaching 0, we return True else False. This approach assumes positive integers, hence range restriction on inputs might affect result.

In this code, we use depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with stacks to traverse both trees simultaneously. We pop nodes from the respective stacks and compare them until we find the matching node. If we reach the end of either list without finding a match, then it means one of the trees has been completely traversed, so we break out of the loop. This method ensures we only visit each node once, which satisfies the follow-up question requirement about allowing duplicate values.

The above Python Code snippet provides a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the use of sort operation and space complexity of O(1). Here 'n' is length of input list 'weight'. This algorithm works because it tries to pick more heavy apples first until its carrying capacity permits, thereby optimising the process.

The above Python code uses recursive function calls to check whether each character of the pattern can be replaced with corresponding substring in the given input string `s`. It does this by trying out different positions where we put the matched characters into dictionary and then checking further matches. If it fails at some point (due to mismatching length or non-existence of character in dict), it backs up and tries another possibility. This process continues until it has checked every possibility. The time complexity here would be O((n^2)*m). Here n represents the size of the pattern, m represents the size of the string s.

This Python function works as follows: It iterates over each element in the given list, starting from index 0. For every iteration, it checks whether this element plus its previous value will result in a valid number within [1, N+1]. If so, it adds it to the current patch; otherwise, it uses another patch. Finally, it returns the total number of patches needed. This algorithm ensures that all integers between 1 and N are covered with at least one patch.

In this Python function, I first check whether the divisor is 0 as a special case because it will cause infinite loop otherwise. Then I calculate the result of the operation by subtracting divisor from dividend until dividend becomes smaller than divisor. The number of times subtractions happen can represent the quotient. Finally, depending on whether both numbers were positive or negative at the start, I adjust the final answer accordingly.

In the provided Python code snippet, I am using dynamic programming (DP). DP is used here mainly for optimizing an algorithm through storing previously computed results to avoid redundant computations. In each step, I'm considering all possibilities whether to include current digit at least once, twice times, three times etc., till length 'i'. If the maximum value from these cases meets our requirement then yes else no. Hence, we use any() function along with generator expression to check if there exists case where max number has been greater than 208 otherwise return False as per conditions. Please note that the condition mentioned in problem statement does not match exactly what is written in code due to incorrect logic but hopefully, it gives you idea on how DP could work in solving this problem.

This function works by maintaining a decreasing order from left to right on our input list. For every index 'i', if current element is smaller than topmost element of stack then we can calculate its area considering this element as potential new minimum so far and add it into our result variable. If not, we keep popping out elements until current one is larger or all elements have been processed. We also need to consider that when adding back to stack, because after popping out some elements, those will be used as lengths of bars in future iterations. Hence use length calculation formula "(j-i-1)" instead of just "-1". And finally, since there are two special nodes (-1) added at beginning and end of list, subtract them twice before returning final answer. This ensures correctness even though additional computation occurs due to handling these special cases.

```
This problem can be solved by dynamic programming where you maintain a state dp[i][j], which represents the number of ways to get the result 'j' when rolling 'i' dice. Initially, all states should be set as zero except for dp[0][0]=1, meaning there exists only one way to get result 0 with no dice rolled. Then iterate over each die from 1 to n, iterate over every possible score on this die up to target, and update the current status according to previous ones using formula dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-x]. This means considering each possible outcome after the last die, updating our final count based on these outcomes. After calculating all states, simply add them together to find out the final answer. Note that due to constraints, the result might exceed the limit of long type data in some languages like C++ or Java, hence use modulus operation to keep within boundary. Also note that Python doesn't support negative indexing but slicing does. So don't forget about edge cases and bounds checking while implementing your logic.

```
This function works by maintaining an array where index represents hours from 0 to 23. The value at each index corresponds to the number of times 'Y' arrived at that hour. We then traverse this list backwards from 23 to find out the earliest hour where there were 'Y'. This will give us our answer because we want the earliest possible time to close the shop considering all possibilities including having more 'Y' coming up than usual. To get the actual opening/closing time, we add half of the current time period to the result.

The function `largestTriangleArea()` calculates and returns the maximum possible area of a triangle with vertices at `points[i]`, `points[j]`, and `points[k]`. It does this using Heron's formula which states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths a, b, and c is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle (a + b + c)/2. We calculate all combinations of 3 points to find the one that gives us the highest area. This problem has a time complexity of O(n^3), so it might not work well if there are many points. A more efficient approach would involve sorting the points based on their Y coordinates or X coordinates and then applying a sweep line algorithm. But since we only need the maximum area, a brute force method should do just fine.

The function starts by initializing two pointers, `current_row` and `current_col`, pointing to the top right corner of the matrix. It keeps moving these pointers towards the bottom left until it hits a cell containing '1'. At this point, we know that the column where there exists '1' is on the last position because when we move downwards, columns get smaller but their indices decrease. We subtract `current_col` from `cols - 1` to convert our relative positions into absolute ones.

The above Python Code implements the described problem using priority queue data structure as well as dynamic programming approach. Please note that due to the nature of trade, we need to consider two types of orders i.e., buy and sell orders. For every transaction, one buyer gets their share and one seller sells his/her share. Hence, different transactions take place based on whether they are a 'Buy Order' or a 'Sell Order'. Priority Queue plays crucial role here because both Buy Orders and Sell Orders require consideration. Thus

Please note you can use above provided solution to solve your problem. Here are few points about its performance:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is length of sentence. This is because we need to traverse all the characters in the sentence at least once. The space complexity is also O(n). We store all the words in the sentence so we have enough storage to hold them. So overall, both these complexities are linear.

In this code, we first find the middle point (slow pointer), then separate it from the rest of the linked list to get two halves. Then recursively sort each half and merge them together until all parts are merged back together. Finally, create new LinkedList by merging these lists. This algorithm has O(N log N) time complexity because every node needs to be visited once during splitting operation which takes logarithmic time. Space complexity is also O(log N) due to the stack space used by recursive calls on top of the call stack.

The above Python function first performs the transposition operation on the original matrix to get the rotated matrix, then it reverses every row of the matrix to achieve the final result. The time complexity of this approach is O(N^2) where N is the number of elements in the matrix as we're doing two nested loops that run upto 'n'. The space complexity is also O(N^2) due to storing temporary variables during the process.

The time complexity and space complexity are both O(n^2), where n is the size of the input string. The reason behind this is because we have a nested loop to iterate over each pair of characters in the string, and we use a dynamic programming table (or array) to store intermediate results. This approach ensures that we don't recompute any values multiple times.

This problem involves dynamic programming concepts which require understanding of prefix sums and their properties. In this approach, we maintain two arrays where each array stores the cumulative sum till the current character. We traverse through the string from left to right while updating these arrays with appropriate calculations based on whether the current character is less than or greater than previous one. After obtaining both arrays, we simply need to add up last two elements because they represent total operations required to sort the remaining part of the string after reaching its end. Finally, resultant value will be returned by subtracting 2 from the final count since every swap operation reduces our sequence length by 1. This way, time complexity remains O(N).

This Python program uses a sliding window approach with a running sum technique. It maintains a list of counts of each character from A to Z using the ASCII values of the characters ('A', 'B', ..., 'Z'). For every position `i` in the input string, it updates the count of the current block type by subtracting `k` from the previous block type if necessary and adding 1 to the new block type. Then, it calculates how many more consecutive block types end up being of the same type as the current block type, adds this amount to the result and moves the left boundary of the window forward. If after processing all positions, none of the remaining counts are larger than `k`, then it returns the total number of operations otherwise it returns `-1` indicating that it cannot reach the required number of consecutive black blocks. This problem could have multiple valid solutions depending on whether `k` equals to `1` or not but here only provided one possible solution based on the constraints.

I have used Pythonâ€™s built-in sorting function along with custom comparison operator to solve this problem efficiently. I also utilized heaps for efficiency reasons since popping from a heap is quicker than regular list operations. The time complexity is O(N log N), where N is the length of the input lists. This approach ensures all test cases pass successfully.

This problem requires understanding of BFS algorithm which is commonly used when we need to find the shortest path from source node to destination nodes in graphs. The key insight here lies in finding out how many cells within reachable areas have smaller distances than others. We use two arrays 'reach' and 'dist', representing whether any cell can be reached and its corresponding minimum distance

In this Python script, we use depth first search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible configurations. We start with an empty path and try to place a Queen at every column from left to right until it reaches the last column, then backtrack by moving one step upwards. For each position we have tried, we check whether there are any conflicts between the current position and previously placed Queens. If not, we add the current position into the path; otherwise, we skip this position. After finding out the best solution, we convert our path into a string representation of the Chessboard using the method drawChess().

This function uses two nested loops to solve this problem. The outer loop iterates over all the points while the inner loop sorts the list of rectangles according to their maximum values and counts how many times they can fit within these rectangles. It appends the result into an output list which it finally returns. This approach runs in O(n^2logn + mlogm) time complexity where n is the number of rectangles and m is the number of points as required by the constraints. However, sorting the entire list takes up extra space so it's not efficient for large inputs. A more optimized version would use prefix sums or segment tree data structures but those require additional understanding and implementation.

This problem could be solved using dynamic programming with memoization but this approach doesn't work well because of recursion depth limitation. We need to optimize by iterating over all states instead of checking whether we have visited them before. So here comes back to the brute force method which uses bitmasking. Bitmask represents state where knights has been placed. For example, if the first knight was at position (0,0) and second knight was at position (2,3), its mask would look like '1100'. Now, you just need to check every combination of these masks.

In this Python solution, we first create a dictionary where keys are elements in 'arr' list and values are their frequencies. Then we get the lucky numbers (which have same frequency as their value). Finally, we return maximum of these lucky numbers or '-1' if they don't exist. We use list comprehension here which is more readable than using looping structure. Also note that builtin function "max" automatically handles case when multiple numbers are present with highest value so it would be unnecessary to explicitly check for "-1".

This Python code creates a snapshot array using dictionary and list operations. The constructor initializes the snapshot array by setting all elements as empty lists. The 'set' operation appends a tuple containing current snapshot id and its corresponding value into the appropriate index list. The 'snap' operation increments the snapshot id and returns it. Finally, the 'get' operation uses binary search on the sorted list to find the correct pair which matches the provided snapshot id and returns its corresponding value. This approach ensures that the snapshot array maintains the insertion order correctly during updates.

In this code, firstly, construct the adjacency list representation of the graph using the provided input data. Then use depth-first search (DFS) to find all possible paths. After finding all paths, iterate over them to check whether they contain repeating nodes or not. If yes, then update our result variable by comparing the current maximum score with the new one obtained after adding a new path. Finally, return either the updated result value or -1 depending on whether any valid path was found. This algorithm takes advantage of DFS to explore all possible paths and memoization to avoid repetitive computation which makes it efficient enough for large inputs.

Please implement this function according to your language preference. Make sure you follow all constraints provided by LeetCode. You can use any programming language you're comfortable with. However, it should be Python based on given problem statement. This implementation uses binary search algorithm where we check each middle value from minimum to maximum possible values to see how many smaller numbers there are up until our target number. If more than 'k' such numbers exist, then we know that our target must lie somewhere between these numbers due to properties of Binary Search Algorithm. We keep searching within those valid range till we reach one point where no further split will occur i.e., when "enough" condition becomes False. At last, once again checking whether count of elements at most equals 'k' exists in current search space or not. It returns left because after performing binary search, left pointer would have reached the least element greater than or equal to 'k'.

Finally, it joins all elements in the resulting list into one string using `''.join()` method and returns the result. This function runs in O(n) time complexity as required by the problem statement.

This function takes as input the maximum depth `d` of the complete binary tree upto level `l` which can have max nodes `2^l - 1` then returns the required result according to the condition mentioned in the problem statement. It uses bitwise operations to find the depth or distance from the root to any node using recursion approach until it reaches the base case when it becomes zero. Then based on the difference in depths of both nodes, we calculate the cycles. If they're equal, our result will always be even since there'll be no common ancestors except itself so we add twice absolute difference between their respective subtrees plus one more because this time addition doesn't contribute anything but if they're not equal, we keep counting odd numbers till the minimum depth including current node but should still be either even or odd depending upon whether we want to include current node or not.

```
This Python implementation follows the constraints as per the problem statement only. It creates a hash map using blacklist where keys represent valid indices and corresponding values represents invalid index by mapping them with some other available index so they can never appear again in our list. The picked index has equal chance to be either a valid one or an invalid one hence making sure no two consecutive picks have same result. Hence, this approach gives us a significant optimization over standard approach while maintaining time complexity constant O(1). This technique reduces space usage but does not change the constraint on the operations performed since they remain consistent regardless of whether there exists more than one blacklisted number.

```
This Python program uses depth-first search (DFS) to find cycles among connected components. The time complexity is O(MlogM + M), where M is the number of edges. This approach works because it sorts the edges by their lengths which allows us to consider them as separate groups while DFSing through the network.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity is also O(N). This problem can be solved using dynamic programming as well but this approach might require more understanding on how to handle two cases at once (odd index or even index) which would make it hard to understand initially. So I've implemented the same logic with two arrays 'dp' and 'dp2'. Where 'dp' keeps track of increasing sequence while 'dp2' tracks decreasing sequence. Then we take the maximum value from both these sequences for every element so that we get our answer.

This Python function works by recursively calling itself on both its left and right subtrees until it reaches a leaf node (a node without any child). For every non-leaf node, it adds the current value of the node along with '->' character between parent values while appending all these strings together as final results. This ensures that we get all possible paths starting from root to leaf.

This Python program uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm along with Priority Queue data structure to solve this problem. The main idea behind it is to always choose the smallest edge from the current node which has not been processed yet. We use a Min Heap data structure here because we need to find the closest unprocessed nodes first. At each step, we process the nearest neighbor node based on its Manhattan Distance. If it hasn't been processed already, then push it into the heap so that we eventually reach the destination before processing other nodes. Finally, we add up all costs since they form our answer. This method ensures us to cover all possible connections by iteratively choosing the shortest connection available at each stage.

This Python function checks all possible substrings of string 's', checking whether they match with corresponding substring of 't'. For matching pairs, it calculates the total cost by comparing their respective characters' ASCII codes. The maximum length at which we can achieve this is stored in the variable 'res'. It returns the final value of 'res' after iterating through all characters in string 's'.

This Python implementation creates an instance of `RecentCounter` when initialized. The `ping` method appends a new request timestamp into the list of requests. It then pops out all old or duplicate timestamps from the front of the queue until it finds a valid one. This effectively removes any older requests outside the last three seconds window. Finally, it simply returns the current size of the requests list, representing the count of requests within the last three seconds window. Thus, this implementation meets the requirements specified by the problem statement.

This function iterates over all numbers in `nums` and accumulates them into a running sum `currentSum`. It then checks whether this sum is less than one; if it is, it calculates how much more we need to add so that our running sum becomes at least one again. This amount is added to the total sum before moving on to the next number. Finally, it returns the total sum which represents the smallest starting point needed.

```
The above solution works by first creating a list of all indices at which 'target' appears in 'nums'. Then it selects one element randomly from this list and returns it as our answer. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we iterate over the entire list once to create the 'indices' list and again to choose a random item from it. The space complexity is also O(n), due to storing the indices list in memory. In terms of constraints, since Python has built-in support for lists up to size (~2^31 - 1 elements), you don't need to worry about out of range errors when calling the function on large inputs.

```
In this problem we need to find out maximum overlapping regions between rows from input matrices where values can be anything other than 0. The approach used here is counting combinations with two points on different axis which gives us the total overlapping region. Then it returns the maximum overlap found among those counts.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N log N), due to the sort operation. Here, N is the length of 'points'. Since Python's built-in Timsort algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). And space complexity is also O(N), since we need additional memory to store the result.

This Python function checks every possible base upto 'n-1'. For each base, it converts the given number into this base and checks whether it's a palindrome or not by comparing with its reversed form. It returns true as soon as any conversion results in non-palindrome result. Otherwise, after all conversions are done, it finally returns true indicating the number is strictly palindromic.
