This solution works by creating a new polynomial linked list using a dummy node. It then iterates over both input lists simultaneously. If the powers of the two nodes being compared are equal, it adds the coefficients and creates a new node with this summed coefficient and the same power. If the summed coefficient is not zero, it appends this node to the result list. If the power of the first node is greater than the power of the second node, it directly appends the first node to the result list. If the power of the second node is greater, it does the same for the second node. After iterating over one of the input lists, it appends the remaining nodes from the other input list to the result list. Finally, it returns the head of the result list.

This code creates a frequency count array of size 26 for each substring of `s`. It then calculates the beauty of each substring by subtracting the minimum frequency from the maximum frequency and adds this value to the result. The beauty sum is the total sum of beauties of all substrings.

To run this code, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `beautySum` method on your string `s`. For example:

```python
sol = Solution()
print(sol.beautySum("aabcb"))  # Output: 5
print(sol.beautySum("aabcbaa"))  # Output: 17
```
*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
Given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold, we will choose a set of integers and remove every included integer from the array. Afterwards, our score will be the sum of the divisors of the remaining numbers in the array. What is the smallest possible score we can get?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5], threshold = 12
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** We can pick [1,2,3,4,5] and reduce the array to []. The divisors of the remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so the score is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. However, we can improve the score to 18 by removing 1 from the array. The divisors of the remaining numbers are 1

```

This class uses Python's built-in `Counter` to count the frequency of each number in `nums`. Then it sorts the counts in ascending order, but when counts are equal, it sorts the numbers in descending order (-x[0]). Finally, it builds the result list by repeating each number for its count times.

This code creates an `m x n` matrix filled with zeros, then iterates over each operation in the `ops` list, incrementing each cell within the specified range by one. Finally, it counts the maximum value in each row and sums these counts to return the total number of maximum values in the matrix.

This Python code uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph and color each node with one of two colors. If a conflict occurs (i.e., a neighbor has the same color as the current node), the function `dfs` returns False, indicating that it's impossible to divide the group. If all nodes can be colored without conflicts, the function returns True. The main function checks for each unvisited node whether it can be divided using DFS.

This solution works by converting the sentence into a set, which automatically removes duplicate characters. Then, it checks if the length of this set is 26, which represents the number of unique letters in the English alphabet. If the length is 26, then every letter of the alphabet is present in the sentence, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

If there is any remaining barcode in the heap after processing all other barcodes, it is added to the result.

```

This Python solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible sequences of numbers in the string. It checks whether each sequence is valid by ensuring that the sum of the last two numbers equals the current number.

The solution handles large input integers by avoiding unnecessary computations. Instead of trying to compute the sum of all possible pairs of numbers in the string, it stops when it finds a valid sequence and moves on to the next part of the string. This makes the solution efficient even for large inputs.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), where N is the length of the string. This is because in the worst case scenario, we may have to try every possible substring of the string. The space complexity is O(N), due to the recursive call stack.

In this Python code, we use recursive inorder traversal to flatten the binary search tree. During the traversal, we keep track of the previous node using a class variable `self.prev`. We set the right child of the previous node to the current node and the left child of the current node to `None`. After the traversal, we return the right child of the dummy node, which is the new root of the incrementally larger tree.

Please note that the TreeNode class definition is assumed to exist in your codebase. A TreeNode object should have two attributes: `val` (an integer) and `left`, `right` (both either None or TreeNode objects).

This solution assumes that you have a binary search tree where each node has a unique value. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the solution accordingly.

In the above code, the function `reorderedPowerOf2` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be rearranged to form a power of 2, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the bitwise left shift operator `<<` to generate power of 2 numbers from 0 to 30. Then it sorts the digits of `n` and compares it with the sorted digits of all generated powers of 2. If `n` can be rearranged to form a power of 2, then it will be found in the list of sorted digits of all generated powers of 2.

Please note that this solution assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer.

This python code defines a function `minWindow` that takes two strings `s` and `t` as input and returns the smallest window of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such window exists, it returns an empty string.
It uses a sliding window approach to solve the problem. The left pointer `l` and the right pointer `r` define the window. The `window_counts` dictionary stores the count of characters in the current window. When the count of a character equals the required count in `t`, `formed` is incremented. When `formed` equals `required`, a valid window is found. Then the left pointer is moved

**Explain:**

This Python solution uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. We compare the characters in A and B and add unequal characters from both strings to s1 and s2 respectively. Then we pop the last characters from both lists until they are equal. The length of s1 is the minimum number of swaps required to make A similar to B.

This Python solution uses a disjoint-set data structure (DSU) to track the connected components. It starts by sorting the edges in descending order based on their weights. Then, for each edge, it tries to union the two nodes it connects. If they are already connected, it skips this edge; otherwise, it adds this edge to the result and unions the two nodes. Finally, it checks if all nodes are connected. If not, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the total number of edges minus the number of added edges.

This class defines a method called `maskPII` that takes a string `S` as input. If `S` contains an '@', it assumes that `S` is an email address and masks it accordingly. If `S` does not contain an '@', it assumes that `S` is a phone number and masks it accordingly.

The method uses the built-in `filter` function to get the digits from `S` and the `split` function to split `S` into two parts at the '@' symbol. The first part of the email address is then masked by replacing the middle characters with '*****'. The domain part of the email address is also converted to lower case.

If the phone number is 10 digits long, it is masked by replacing the middle 8 digits with '***-***-'. If the phone number is longer than 10 digits, the country code is masked by replacing the middle digits with '*'. The local part of the phone number remains the same.

This Python code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first initializes a list `dp` with size `n`, where `n` is the length of `nums`, and all elements are 1. This list `dp` stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subarray ending at index `i`.

Then it iterates over `nums` from index 1 to `n-1`. If `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[i-1]`, it means that we can extend the subarray ending at `i-1` by appending `nums[i]` to the end, so the length of the longest strictly increasing subarray ending at `i` is `dp[i-1] + 1`.

Finally, it returns the sum of all elements in `dp`, which is the total number of strictly increasing subarrays.

```

```
Please note that this problem requires dynamic programming approach. The basic idea is to define a state dp[i][j] to represent the number of ways to stay at index 0 after exactly i steps and currently at position j. Then we can use a transition function to update our state. In this case, we have three choices at each step: move left, move right, or stay put. The transition function is defined based on these choices. Finally, we return dp[steps][0] as the result.

In this problem, we need to handle the situation when the pointer is at the boundary of the array. For example, when the pointer is at position 0, we cannot move left; when the pointer is at position arrLen - 1, we cannot move right. Therefore, we need to limit the maximum length of the array that the pointer can reach according to the number of steps.

This solution has a time complexity of O(steps * min(steps, arrLen)) and a space complexity of O(steps * arrLen), which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

This solution works by trying to make the string alternate with both '0' and '1' as the starting character, and returning the minimum number of changes required. The helper function `count_changes` counts the number of changes required to make the string alternate with a certain starting character.

```
In the code above, we first calculate the number of common prefix bits of `left` and `right` by continuously shifting both numbers to the right until they become equal. This gives us the common prefix of `left` and `right`. Then we shift `left` back to the original position by shifting it `shift` times to the left. This gives us the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range `[left, right]`.

This solution works by first transforming the graph representation to a list of lists where index i contains the nodes connected to node i. Then it creates a result list of size n with all zeros. For every node i in the graph, it assigns the smallest available color to the garden i by taking the set difference of all colors and the colors of the adjacent gardens.

For example, if we have 3 gardens connected as shown in the first example, the result list will look like this:

\[1, 2, 3\]

where 1, 2, and 3 represent the flower types planted in gardens 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the total value of each subtree and the maximum value of a child subtree. The maximum score is achieved by selecting two subtrees whose total values are maximized.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as each node is visited once during DFS. The space complexity is O(n), as the space required for the adjacency list and recursion stack is proportional to the number of nodes.

Here is the solution code:

class Solution:

```
In this solution, we first convert each item into a tuple representing the price-to-weight ratio, the weight, and the price. We then create a max heap using Python's heapq module from this list.

Next, we iteratively pop items from the heap, checking if the weight of the item can fit in the remaining capacity of the bag. If it can, we add the price to our total value and subtract the weight from the remaining capacity. If it can't, we add a fraction of the item's price to our total value and break the loop.

Finally, we return the total value if the bag is fully filled, otherwise return -1.

This python code solves the problem by using depth-first search (DFS) to visit each node of the tree. For each node, it counts the occurrence of each label in its subtree and compares it with the count of the label of the current node. If there is a mismatch, it means the tree is not a valid subtree, so it returns -1 and an empty list. Otherwise, it updates the result list and returns the count of the labels in the subtree.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input tree is a valid tree (i.e., no cycles and is connected). If you need to handle invalid inputs, you should add checks for these conditions.

This Python code uses a dynamic programming approach with a stack. It iterates over the books array from left to right, updating the maximum number of books that can be picked at each point. It uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the books that can be picked, and for each book, it calculates the maximum number of books that can be picked considering the constraint that the number of books on the previous shelf should be less than the current shelf. It then updates the maximum number of books that can be picked at the current index. Finally, it returns the maximum number of books that can be picked from the entire bookshelf.

This solution uses a stack to keep track of the characters in the string. It iterates over the string, and for each character, it checks if it's 'a' or 'b'. If it is, it adds it to the stack. If the last character in the stack is not 'c' and the current character is 'b', it removes the last character from the stack. Otherwise, it adds the current character to the stack. Finally, it returns the length of the stack, which is the minimum length of the string after performing the above operation any number of times.

Please note that this code uses backtracking technique and depth-first search to solve the problem. It iterates over each cell in the grid and tries to match the word with the characters in the grid. If a match is found, it continues the process in the next adjacent cell in the grid. If all characters in the word are matched, it returns True. If not, it backtracks and tries another path. This continues until all cells in the grid are visited. If no match is found, it returns False.

Please note that this code does not handle the follow-up question about search pruning. To handle the larger `board`, you might want to implement some kind of search pruning like a trie or a prefix tree to avoid unnecessary searches.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
Given a string `s`, you can convert `s` to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can create by performing this transformation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aacecaaa"
**Output:** "aaacecaaa"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abcd"
**Output:** "dcbabcd"

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
**Code solution:** 
 
    ```python
def shortestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    rev_s = s[::-1]
    for i in range(n):
        if s.startswith(rev_s[i:]):
            return rev_s[:i] + s
    return ''
```
    
This Python solution works by reversing the input string and then iteratively checking if the reversed string starts with the suffix of the original string. If it does, we know that the prefix of the reversed string is the shortest palindrome that can be created by appending characters to the start of the string. We then return this palindrome. If no

This implementation uses a concept called "hashing". We create a larger array of smaller arrays (buckets), where each index of the larger array corresponds to a smaller array. Each smaller array represents a bucket, and it stores the presence of numbers in the range of 0 to 1000.

The hash function calculates the modulus of the key to determine the bucket where the key should go. The position function calculates the integer division of the key to determine the position within the bucket.

The add operation checks if the corresponding bucket is empty. If it is, it creates a new smaller array to represent the bucket. Then, it marks the corresponding position in the smaller array as 1 to indicate that the key is present.

The remove operation simply marks the corresponding position in the smaller array as 0 to

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum sum of ASCII values of characters that need to be deleted from both strings to make them equal. The time complexity is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the two input strings. The space complexity is also O(mn).

Here is how you can use this class:

print(sol.minimumDeleteSum("sea", "eat")) # Output: 231
print(sol.minimumDeleteSum("delete", "leet")) # Output: 403

Leetcode problem: 773. Sliding Puzzle

On an 2 x 3 board, there are five tiles labeled from 1 to 5, and an empty square represented by 0.

A move consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

Given the puzzle board `board`, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** No

In this solution, we first generate the array `nums` using a list comprehension. Then we initialize `res` to the first element of `nums`. We then iterate over the remaining elements in `nums`, performing a bitwise XOR operation on `res` and each element, storing the result back in `res`. Finally, we return `res`, which holds the bitwise XOR of all elements in `nums`.

This Python solution uses two pointers approach. The outer loop iterates over the string `s`, updating the counter for each character encountered. The inner loop adjusts the start index `i` of the substring until the substring is balanced. Then, it updates the result with the size of the current substring.

It's important to note that this solution assumes that the input string `s` is always valid and meets the constraints specified in the problem statement.

This code works by iterating over each index in the input list. For each index, it starts a new sequence (if it hasn't been seen before) and continues to add elements to the sequence until it encounters the original starting element again. This forms a cycle. The length of this cycle is recorded and the maximum cycle length found so far is updated.

In the end, the function returns the maximum cycle length found.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because each element in the list is visited exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the extra space used to keep track of whether each element has been seen before.

In this solution, we use a dictionary `map` to map a random index `rand` to a real index `x`. When `flip()` is called, we choose a random index `rand` in `[0, self.total - 1]`, get the corresponding real index `x` from `map` (if `rand` exists in `map`, we get `map[rand]`; otherwise, we get `rand` itself), reduce `total` by 1, and update the mapping for `rand` to the real index of the last cell in the matrix. We then return the coordinates of `x`. When `reset()` is called, we clear `map` and reset `total` to the total number of cells in the matrix.

Please note that this solution assumes that the built-in `random` module of Python provides a function `randint(a, b)` that generates a random integer in `[a, b]`.

Then it iterates over the chalk pieces, subtracting the number of chalk pieces used by each student from the remainder. If the remainder is less than the number of chalk pieces used by the current student, that student has to replace the chalk, so the function returns their index.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (not necessarily distinct), and an integer `target`.

Suppose that `nums` is an array of distinct integers and is sorted in ascending order, and the target is an integer. Write a function that returns the index of the target in the array. If the target is not in the array, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,6,7,8,9\], target = 8
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 8 is located at index 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,6,7,8,9\], target = 5
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** 5 is located at index 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,6,7,8,

```

This solution class has a method called `calculateTax` which takes two parameters, a list of lists and an integer. It calculates the tax based on the given conditions and returns the result.

Test the function with some test cases:

```python
print(Solution().calculateTax([[3,50],[7,10],[12,25]], 10)) # Expected output: 2.65
print(Solution().calculateTax([[1,0],[4,25],[5,50]], 2)) # Expected output: 0.25
print(Solution().calculateTax([[2,50]], 0)) # Expected output: 0.0
```

These test cases cover different scenarios of the problem. The function should pass these tests.

This code works by maintaining a running sum of the numbers in the array and using a dictionary to keep track of how many times we've seen this sum. We then increment our count if we see that the current sum minus the target k is in our dictionary. This means we've found a subarray where the sum equals k. We also update our dictionary with the current sum.

def subarraySum(nums, k):
    prefix_sum_frequency = {0: 1}

        return next(node for node in tree if node.val == child_values - root_value)
```
This solution works by summing up all the values of all nodes and all the values of all children. The root node's value will be different from any child node's value, so we subtract the root value from the sum of all child values to find the root node.

Please note that this solution assumes that the `tree` argument is a list of `Node` objects, where each `Node` has a `val` attribute for the node's value and a `children` attribute for a list of child nodes. If your `Node` class or the format of your input data differs, you may need to adjust this solution accordingly.

This code creates a recursive function called `dfs` which takes in three parameters: `nums` (the remaining numbers to choose from), `path` (the current path), and `result` (the list of all paths). The base case for this recursion is when `nums` is empty, in which case we append `path` to `result`. Then for each number in `nums`, we recursively call `dfs` on the remaining numbers and the current path plus the current number.

You can fill the solution class with your code.

    def numOfBurgers(self, tomatoSlices: int, cheeseSlices: int) -> List[int]:
        total_jumbo = (4 * cheeseSlices - tomatoSlices) / 2
        total_small = cheeseSlices - total_jumbo

            return []
        else:
            return [int(total_jumbo), int(total_small)]
```

This solution works by using the given equation:

`4*J + 2*S = tomatoSlices`
`J + S = cheeseSlices`

where J is the number of jumbo burgers and S is the number of small burgers. Substituting the second equation into the first gives us:

`4*J + 2*cheeseSlices - tomatoSlices = 0`

Solving this equation for J gives us the number of jumbo burgers. Substituting J back into the second equation gives us the number of small burgers. If either of these numbers is negative or not an integer, we return an empty list. Otherwise, we return a list containing the number of jumbo burgers and small burgers.

This Python code uses the built-in `ord` function to convert characters to their ASCII values. It then counts the frequency of each character in both strings using two lists `freq_s` and `freq_t`. Finally, it calculates the difference between the frequencies of each character in both strings and adds up these differences. The minimum number of steps needed to make the two strings anagrams of each other is half of this total difference.

This Python code solves the problem by first counting the number of 1s in each row and each column. Then, it checks each cell in the matrix again to see if it is a 1 and if the count of 1s in the corresponding row and column is exactly 1. If both conditions are met, the cell is a special position and the count is increased. The total count is returned as the result.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval` = `[start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
**Output:** [[1,5],[6,9]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
**Output:** [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
**Explanation:** Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi

        # your code here
```

Please fill in the function body according to the problem statement.

Here is how you should call this function:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.findFarmland([[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]]))  # Output: [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]
print(solution.findFarmland([[1,1],[1,1]]))  # Output: [[0,0,1,1]]
print(solution.findFarmland([[0]]))  # Output: []
```

**Solution:**

This problem can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS). We iterate over the `land` grid and whenever we encounter a cell containing `1` (representing farmland), we perform a DFS from there to find the boundaries of the group of farmland.

```python
class Solution:
    def findFarmland(self, land: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n = len(land), len(land[0])
        res = []
        
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i < 0 or i >= m or j < 0 or j >= n or land[i][j] != 1:
                return []
            land[i][j] = 0
            return [i, j, dfs(i+1, j)[2], dfs(i, j+1)[3]]
            
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if land[i][j] == 1:
                    res.append([i, j] + dfs(i, j))
        return res
```

In the DFS function, we check whether the current cell is within the bounds of the grid and whether its value is `1`. If either condition is not met, we return an empty list. Otherwise, we mark

def findFarmland(land):
    m, n = len(land), len(land[0])

                while j + 1 < n and land[i][j + 1] == 1:

                r2, c2 = i, j

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "()"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "()[]{}"
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Output:** false

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "([)]"
**Output:** false

**Example 5:**

**Input:** s = "{[]}"
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `s` consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

Here is the solution class:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

This code first calculates how many shifts are needed for each character in `s` to match the corresponding character in `t`. Then it sorts these shifts in ascending order. After that, it tries to apply the shifts using the available moves. If it's impossible to apply a certain shift, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it continues trying to apply the remaining shifts. If all shifts can be applied, it returns `True`.

This solution uses a while loop to keep reducing the length of the string `s` until its length is less than or equal to `k`. Inside the loop, it splits `s` into chunks of size `k` using Python's slicing and then calculates the sum of the digits in each chunk using the `map` and `sum` functions. Finally, it joins the sums back together into a single string.

*** Leetcode Example Question 4 ***

You are given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `start` and `end`.

Initially, you have a pointer at index `start`. At each step, you can move the pointer to either index `start + 1`, `start + 2`, ..., `end` (you can move it to any index in this range), or to index `end - 1`, `end - 2`, ..., `start` (you can move it to any index in this range). You may repeat this process any number of times.

Your score is the sum of the values of the numbers at indices `start` and `end` when you move your pointer to these indices.

Your target score is the maximum possible score.

            return self.find(root.left, value)
        
        return self.find(root.right, value)
```

The solution works by recursively traversing both trees and checking if there exists a pair of values that sum up to the target value. The `twoSumBSTs` function traverses the first tree and for each node, it checks if there exists a value in the second tree such that the sum of the node value and this value equals the target. The `find` function is used to perform the search in the second tree.

    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):

```
This Python solution uses string slicing to reverse the string, and checks if the reversed string is equal to the original string. If they are equal, the string is a palindrome, and we can remove it in one operation. If they are not equal, the string contains different characters, and we need at least two operations: removing all 'a's first and then all 'b's.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The value 1 has 3 occurrences, the value 2 has 2 occurrences and the value 3 has 1 occurrence. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The value 1 has 1 occurrence, the value 2 has 1 occurrence. There are two values that have the same number of occurrences so it returns false.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,0,3]
**Output:** true

                return i
            leftSum += x
        return -1
```

This Python solution uses a single pass approach to solve the problem. The idea is to calculate the cumulative sum from left to right and simultaneously check if the leftSum equals to the total sum minus the current element and the leftSum. If they are equal, then we found the middle index, otherwise keep adding the current element to the leftSum.

If no such index is found after checking all elements, then return -1.

Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space.

                dp[i] = True
        return dp[n]
```
This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp` array stores whether Alice can win when there are `i` nodes in the tree. The base cases are `dp[1] = False` and `dp[2] = True`. For larger `i`, if Alice cannot win when there are `i-2` nodes and either she cannot win when there are `i-1` nodes or Bob cannot win when there are `i-1` nodes, then Alice can win when there are `i` nodes. Finally, the function returns `dp[n]`.

You are given an integer array `arr`. You can choose a set of integers and remove all occurrences of any of the integers in the array.

Return the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of the array are still in `arr` after applying the operation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Choosing {3,7} will make the new array \[5,5,5,2,2\] which has size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array) and all the elements which were in arr were in it.
Size of the new array when you apply the operation is 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array) and all the elements which were in arr were in it.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[7,7,7,7,7,7\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Choosing {7} will make the new array empty.
Size of the new array when you apply the operation is 1 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array) and all the elements which were in arr were in it.

    def largestEvenSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Your code here
```

I just want the Python code without explanation. Please help me.

```python
class Solution:
    def largestEvenSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        even = sorted([num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0], reverse=True)
        odd = sorted([num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0], reverse=True)
        
        if len(even) < k // 2:
            return -1
        
        if len(odd) < k // 2:
            return sum(even[:k])
        
        return max(sum(even[:k//2*2] + odd[:k//2*2]) for _ in range(2))
```

This solution works by first sorting the numbers into even and odd lists, both in descending order. Then, it checks if there are enough even numbers and odd numbers to form a subsequence of length `k`. If not, it returns `-1`. If there are enough numbers, it forms two subsequences: one of length `k//2*2` using the largest even numbers and odd numbers. It then returns the maximum of these two sums.

ref:
def largest_even_sum(nums, k):
    evens = sorted([num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0], reverse=True)
    odds = sorted([num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0], reverse=True)

    sum = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        if evens:
            sum += evens.pop()

    for _ in range(0, k - 1, 2):
        if odds:
            first = odds.pop()
            if odds:
                second = odds.pop()
                sum += first + second

    return sum if sum % 2 == 0 else -1

```

This Python program defines a class Solution with a method findSecondMinimumValue, which takes a TreeNode object root as input. The function finds the second smallest value in the tree by iteratively searching the tree for values greater than the minimum value and less than the current smallest found second minimum. If it does not find any such value, it returns -1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because in the worst case scenario, we have to visit every node once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the recursive call stack during DFS.

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):

            if root.val != root.left.val:

                candidate = num
            count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

        return candidate
```

This solution uses the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which operates on the principle that the majority element must exist because it exceeds half the length of the array. The algorithm iterates through the array once, keeping track of the current candidate and the count of the candidate. If the next number is the same as the candidate, the count is incremented; otherwise, the count is decremented. If the count reaches zero, the next number is set as the candidate. This process ensures that the candidate is the majority element.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1), which satisfies the follow-up requirement.

    count = 0

This Python code solves the problem by using a sliding window approach. It keeps track of the unique characters in the current window and moves the left pointer of the window when the number of unique characters exceeds 2. The maximum length of the substring is updated whenever a longer substring is found.

```
This Python solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree. It records the parent and depth of each node during the DFS. If it finds either `x` or `y`, it updates their respective parent and depth. Finally, it checks if `x` and `y` have the same depth and different parents. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree, because it visits each node once during the DFS. The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree, because it needs to store the recursion call stack. In the worst case, the tree is skewed, so the height of the tree is N.

*** Leetcode Example Question 4 ***
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nagaram. Determine whether a given string `s` is an anagram of a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward. Onlyconsider the lowercase letter.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "carerac"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "racecar"
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 5000`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
**Code solution:** 
 
    ```python
def can_form_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    count = [0]*26
    for char in s:
        count[ord(char)-ord('a')] ^= 1
    return sum(count) <= 1
```
    
This Python function uses a bitwise XOR operation to toggle the corresponding bit in the count array whenever it encounters a character in the string. After traversing all characters in the string, it checks the total number of bits that are still set in the count array. A string can form a palindrome if and only if at most one bit is set. This condition is checked by evaluating `sum(count) <= 1`. If the total number of set bits is more than 1, it means there are more than one distinct characters in the string, which cannot form a palindrome.

def containsNearbyDuplicate(nums, k):
    value_index_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num in value_index_map and i - value_index_map[num] <= k:

This Python code uses depth-first search (DFS) to solve the problem. It first parses the string `s` and categorizes the characters into different levels according to the curly brackets. Then, it generates all possible combinations of the characters at each level using DFS. Finally, it sorts the generated words and returns them.

This solution uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the "it" people. For each "it" person, it calculates the left boundary and right boundary of the range they can catch people. Then it counts the number of "it" people who can catch more than one person within their range.

Note that the range of each "it" person is `[left[i], right[i]]`. If `left[i]` and `right[i]` are both -1 or n, then the "it" person cannot catch anyone. If `right[i] - left[i] - 1 <= 2 * dist`, then the "it" person cannot catch more than one person within their range. Therefore, we skip these "it" people when counting the number of people they can catch.

This Python solution uses a brute force approach. It iterates over all possible binary numbers of length `n`, converts each number to a binary string and checks if it exists in the `nums` list. If it doesn't exist, it returns the binary string.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input list `nums` contains unique binary strings and that `n` is less than or equal to 16. This is because the maximum possible value of `n` is 16 and there are 2^16 possible binary strings. If `n` is greater than 16, this solution will take too long to execute.

The above python code implements a MaxStack class which maintains two stacks: `stack` and `max_stack`. The `push` method appends an element to both stacks. The `pop` method removes and returns the top element from both stacks. The `top` method simply returns the top element from the `stack`. The `peekMax` method returns the top element from the `max_stack`, which is the maximum element in the stack. The `popMax` method finds and removes the maximum element from the stack by comparing elements in both stacks.

```
This code works by iterating over the array and checking whether the maximum value in the left part of the array is less than or equal to the minimum value in the right part of the array. This indicates that the left part is smaller than or equal to the right part, meaning they can be combined together to form a sorted array. The sum function then counts the number of True values, which represents the number of chunks. Finally, we add 1 to account for the last chunk which doesn't need a comparison.

In this code, we use a stack to store the characters of the expression.

If it's not '?', we simply push it to the stack. Finally, the remaining character in the stack is the result of the whole expression.

In this class, we initialize an empty list `self.logs` to store the logs. In the `put` method, we append the log to `self.logs`. In the `retrieve` method, we iterate over `self.logs` and return the ids of logs whose timestamp is within the range from `start` to `end`. We use Python slicing to get the part of timestamp that we care about according to the granularity.

The time complexity of `put` is O(1) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of logs. The time complexity of `retrieve` is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).

This Python program defines a class `ListNode` for creating nodes of the linked list. Then, `insertionSortList` function takes the head of the linked list as an argument and sorts it using the insertion sort algorithm. This function first checks if the head is None (which means the list is empty) and returns it immediately. Then, it creates a pseudo head of the list and points it to the head. After that, it enters a loop where it iterates over the list. Inside this loop, it compares the current node's value with the next node's value. If the current node's value is greater than the next node's value, it enters another loop where it tries to find the correct position for the next node in the sorted part of the list. Once the position is found, it rearranges the pointers to insert the next node into the sorted part of the list. Finally, it continues this process until the entire list is sorted. The function then returns the head of the sorted list.

    This Python solution uses a dictionary to map each character to an integer value, where `'L'` maps to `1` and `'R'` maps to `-1`. It then iterates over each character in the string `s`, adding the corresponding integer value to a running total `count`. If `count` reaches `0`, it means we've found a balanced string, so `res` is incremented by `1`. Finally, the function returns `res`, which represents the maximum number of balanced strings we can obtain.

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `partition` that takes a string `s` as input. The method uses depth-first search (DFS) to find all possible palindrome partitions of the string `s`. The helper function `isPalindrome` checks whether a substring of `s` is a palindrome. The DFS function `dfs` finds all possible partitions by recursively checking substrings of `s` that are palindromes and adding them to the path. The base case of the DFS is when the starting index `start` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, at which point the path is added to the result. Finally, the method returns the result.

This function uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to remove the invalid node and every node underneath it. The `seen` set keeps track of the nodes that have been visited, and if we encounter a node whose value is already in `seen`, we know it is invalid and we remove it along with every node underneath it.

Finally, it returns the size of the set.

This Python class defines a method named `countPartitions` which takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k` as inputs. It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to split the numbers into two groups such that each group has a sum greater than or equal to `k`. The result is returned modulo `10**9 + 7` to prevent overflow.

The class first checks if the total sum of the numbers is less than twice the value `k`. If so, it returns 0 because no partition can satisfy the condition.

If the total sum is greater than or equal to twice the value `k`, the class creates a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to get a sum of `i` using the numbers in `nums`.

Then it iterates over each number in `nums` from left to right. For each number, it updates the DP table by adding the ways to get a sum of `i-num` to the ways to get a sum of `i`.

Finally, it calculates the total number of partitions by raising 2 to the power of the length of `nums` and subtracts the number of great partitions from it. The number of great partitions is calculated by summing up the DP table and multiplies it by 2.

The function `pow(x, y, z)` is used to calculate `(2^n) % mod` in an efficient way.

```
This solution uses a list to keep track of the characters in the string. When it encounters a star, it pops the last character from the list. This way, it effectively removes the closest non-star character to the left of the star.

Test this solution with the following test cases:

```python
print(Solution().removeStars("leet**cod*e")) # should print "lecoe"
print(Solution().removeStars("erase****")) # should print ""
```
*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
Given a string s, return _the length of the longest substring that contains **at most** two distinct characters_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "eceba"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest substring with at most two distinct characters is "ece".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "ccaabbb"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The longest substring with at most two distinct characters is "aabbb".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `s` consists of English letters.
**Code solution:** 

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    if n < 3:
        return n

    left, right = 0, 0
    max_len = 2
    hashmap = dict()

    while right < n:

        return res
```
This Python solution uses a Counter to count the occurrence of each character in the string `s`. Then, it iterates over the values of the counter. For each value `v`, it adds `v // 2 * 2` to the result (because we can use `v // 2 * 2` pairs of characters to form a palindrome). If the result is even and `v` is odd (which means we have used all available pairs and there is still one character left that cannot be used to form a palindrome), then it adds 1 to the result. The result is the length of the longest palindrome that can be built from `s`.

```
In this solution, we use a stack to simulate the process of giving characters to the robot. We keep track of the count of each character in the string `s`. Then, we iterate over `s` again, removing characters from `s` and adding them to our stack. If the top of our stack has all its characters accounted for in `s`, we pop it off and add it to our result. Finally, we join our result and return it.

This code defines a function `inorderSuccessor` which takes a root of a binary search tree and a node `p` as arguments and returns the in-order successor of `p` in the BST. The solution is based on the property of BST where in-order traversal gives a sorted sequence of the nodes in the BST. Therefore, if `p` has an in-order successor, it must be the node whose value is just larger than `p` in the in-order traversal.

            moves += max(need - num, 0)
            need = max(need, num) + 1
        return moves
```

This Python solution uses a greedy approach. First, it sorts the input list `nums`. Then, it iterates over the sorted `nums` list. For each number, it calculates the minimum additional moves needed to make this number unique by comparing it with the smallest number that has already been seen (`need`). If the current number is smaller than `need`, it means we need to increase this number to `need` to make it unique. The total number of moves is then increased by this amount. Finally, `need` is updated to be either the current number plus one or the previous `need`, whichever is larger. This ensures that all numbers to the right of the current number in the sorted list are at least as large as the current number plus one.

This solution works because it always tries to make the smallest possible increment to make the current number unique, and this way ensures that all numbers in the final result are unique and their sum is minimized. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(1) since no extra space is used.

```

In this code, we start from both ends of the input array `nums`. We compare the transformed values at the start and end of the array. Whichever value is greater, we put it into the result array at the corresponding position (either beginning or end, depending on whether `a` is positive or negative). Then we move towards the center of the array, always choosing the larger value. We continue this process until we've processed all numbers in the array.

Here is the explanation of the above code:

This solution works by iterating over the list of words. It keeps track of the last word added to the result list, res. For each word in the input list, it sorts the characters in the word and compares it to the sorted characters of the last word in res. If they are not equal, it means the words are not anagrams of each other, so it adds the word to the result list. If they are equal, it skips the word. This way, the function ensures that only non-anagram words are added to the result list.

ref:
def anagramOperations(words):
    i = 1
    while i < len(words):
        word1 = sorted(words[i])

        if word1 == word2:

```
This solution converts each number in `nums` to a string. Then, it sorts `nums` based on the custom comparison function. This comparison function checks whether `b+a` is greater than `a+b`, and if so, it returns a positive value, otherwise it returns a negative value. This sorting process ensures that the numbers are arranged in descending order, resulting in the largest number. Finally, it joins all the numbers in `nums` together into a single string and returns this string. If the resulting string is empty (which can occur if all the numbers in `nums` were zero), it returns '0'.

Here is the Python solution:

        root.val = mini
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.val)
    return root
```

In this Python solution, we recursively traverse down the tree to find the node with the key value. If the key is less than the current node's value, we go left; otherwise, we go right. If we find the node with the key value, we need to handle three cases:

1. The node is a leaf node: We can simply remove the node from the tree.
2. The node has only one child: We replace the node with its child.
3. The node has two children: We replace the node value with the smallest value in the right subtree, then delete that smallest value in the right subtree.

    This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `times` list stores the time needed for each road considering the speed. The `prefix_sum` list is used to store the accumulated time for each road. The `dp` list is used to store the maximum time needed to travel all previous roads with certain number of skips. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of roads. The space complexity is also O(n).

This solution calculates the time needed for each road and keeps track of the accumulated time for each road. Then it iterates over each road and updates the maximum time needed to travel all previous roads with certain number of skips. Finally, it checks if the maximum time needed with certain number of skips is less than or equal to the total time you have before the meeting. If it is, it returns the number of skips; otherwise, it returns -1.

Please note that this solution assumes that the time needed for each road can be calculated accurately by dividing the road length by the speed. If the division result is not an integer, it means you need to wait for the next hour to travel the road.

This code uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each point and a list to store the points in their original order. When adding a new point, it increments the count of that point in the dictionary and adds it to the list if it wasn't already there. When counting squares, it iterates over the stored points and checks for each pair of points whether they could form a square with the query point. If they could, it multiplies the counts of the points in the dictionary to get the number of ways to choose those points.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

You must solve it in O(n) time complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4

In this Python code, we use BFS to solve the problem. We start from the initial state '0000', and try to go to all possible states in one step. We keep track of the number of steps taken so far and return the result when we reach the target.

The function `get_next` generates all possible states from the current state by rotating one digit. We only consider those states that have not been visited before and are not in the deadends list.

The time complexity is O(N), where N is the total number of states (10000 in this case), because we need to visit each state once. The space complexity is also O(N), because we need to store all states in the visited set and queue.

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,7,7,8,8,10\], target = 8
**Output:** \[3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,7,7,8,8,10\], target = 6
**Output:** \[-1,-1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[\], target = 0
**Output:** \[-1,-1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`

This Python solution uses a max heap (represented as a min heap where all elements are negated) to keep track of the lower half of the numbers, and a min heap to keep track of the upper half of the numbers. The max heap is always at least as large as the min heap, or they are the same size (when the total count of numbers is odd).

The time complexity is O(n log n) because each insertion into a heap is O(log n), and we do this n times. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the results and

```
This Python class uses the built-in `split` method to split the input string into words, and the `count` method to count the number of spaces. Then it calculates the number of spaces between words and the extra spaces. Finally, it joins the words with the calculated number of spaces between them and appends the extra spaces at the end.

Test the class with the following test cases:

```python
print(Solution().rearrangeSpaces("  this   is  a sentence  "))  # Output: "this   is   a   sentence "
print(Solution().rearrangeSpaces(" practice   makes   perfect "))  # Output: "practice   makes   perfect  "
```
These tests should pass and print the expected output.

```
In this solution, we use dynamic programming to solve the problem. We start by creating a list `dp` where `dp[i]` is the maximum length of a palindrome that can be obtained using bits in the binary representation of `i`. We then iterate over all subsets of the binary representation of `i` and check if the corresponding substring is a palindrome. If it is, we update `dp[i]` accordingly. After that, we iterate over all possible subsets of the binary representation of `i` and for each subset `i`, we iterate over all possible subsets `j` such that `j` is a subset of `i` and neither `i` nor `j` contains an even number of bits. If `i` and `j` are both palindromes, we update our result `res` with the maximum of `res` and the product of the lengths of `i` and `j`. Finally, we return `res` as our result.

        return res
```

This solution uses a dictionary to keep track of the prefix sums and their counts. It iterates over the `nums` array and updates the current sum and the count of the prefix sums accordingly. If the difference between the current sum and `goal` exists in the prefix sums dictionary, it adds the count of this prefix sum to the result. Finally, it returns the result.

This Python solution uses bit manipulation and dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `count` function counts the number of pairs in `nums` for a given `x`. The `count(high + 1)` and `count(low)` are subtracted to get the number of nice pairs in `nums` within the range `[low, high]`.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxIceCream(self, costs: List[int], coins: int) -> int:
        costs.sort()
        count = 0
        for cost in costs:

            else:
                break
        return count
```

This Python solution sorts the costs array and iterates over it. If the cost of an ice cream bar is less than or equal to the remaining coins, it increases the count and subtracts the cost from the remaining coins. If the cost is greater than the remaining coins, it breaks the loop because buying more ice cream bars would exceed the available coins. The function then returns the count of ice cream bars that can be bought.

In this code, we create a list of vowels. We then iterate over each character in the word. If the character is a vowel, we add the product of the number of times it appears to the start of the string (i+1) and the number of times it appears to the end of the string (len(word)-i) to our total. This is because the character appears (i+1)*(len(word)-i) times in all possible substrings that include the character. Finally, we return the total.

Fill in the missing parts of the solution class:

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperationsMaxProfit(self, customers: List[int], boardingCost: int, runningCost: int) -> int:
        profit, max_profit, rotations, wait, i = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
        while True:
            if i < len(customers):
                wait += customers[i]
            i += 1
            board = min(4, wait)
            profit += board * boardingCost - runningCost
            wait -= board
            rotations += 1
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
            if wait == 0 and i == len(customers):
                break
        return rotations if max_profit > 0 else -1
```

This solution works by simulating the process of the Centennial Wheel. It keeps track of the current profit, maximum profit seen so far, the number of rotations performed, the number of customers waiting at the wheel, and the index in the customers array.

In each iteration, it tries to board as many customers as possible (up to 4), updates the profit based on the number of customers boarded and the costs involved, and decreases the number of waiting customers. If the profit is higher than the maximum profit seen so far, it updates the maximum profit.

It continues this process until there are no more customers waiting and all customers have been served. If the maximum profit is still zero after all rotations, it returns -1 because there is no scenario where the profit is positive. Otherwise, it returns the number of rotations.

        boarding = min(waiting, 4)
        waiting -= boarding
        profit += boarding * boardingCost - runningCost

        if profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = profit
            result = rotations + 1
        rotations += 1

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) twice. In the first DFS, it calculates the total number of nodes in each subtree rooted at each node, and the sum of distances from the root to all nodes in each subtree. In the second DFS, it calculates the sum of distances from the root to all nodes in each subtree.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input represents a valid tree.

This class uses a dictionary to map the length of words to a set of words of that length. This allows us to quickly look up words of a certain length when we're searching. When we add a word, we just add it to the corresponding set. When we're searching, if the word contains a dot, we iterate over all words of the same length and check if they match the pattern. If they do, we return True. If we finish checking all words without finding a match, we return False.

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to compute the height of each subtree. If at any point the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by more than 1, or either subtree is unbalanced, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the height of the current node. Finally, the function checks whether the entire tree is balanced by checking whether the root's height is not -1.

This Python class defines a method `minFallingPathSum` that takes a 2D list `matrix` as input and returns the minimum sum of any falling path through the matrix. The method uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum sum of the falling path ending at each cell. The time complexity of this method is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n^2).

In this solution, we use a dictionary to keep track of prefix sums of nodes in the linked list. When we encounter a prefix sum that we've seen before, it means there's a sequence of nodes that sum up to zero. We remove these nodes from the linked list by adjusting pointers. Finally, we return the head of the modified linked list.

This solution runs in O(n) time complexity where n is the number of nodes in the linked list because we traverse the linked list once. The space complexity is also O(n) because we use a dictionary to store prefix sums.

```
In this solution, we use a sliding window approach to get all binary substrings of length `k`. We then convert each substring to a binary code using bitwise operation. Then we compare the size of the set `got` with `need`, where `need` is the total number of binary codes of length `k`. If they are equal, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

Please note that the time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate over the string once to create the set `got`, and another time to count the number of elements in `got`. The space complexity is also O(n) because of the set `got`.

This Python solution uses two pointers to iterate through both `start` and `target` strings simultaneously. It skips over any blank spaces ('_') in both strings. If it encounters a non-blank character in either string, it checks if the characters match and whether the character in `start` is on the wrong side of the target string. If they don't match or the character in `start` is on the wrong side, it immediately returns `False`. If it manages to iterate through both strings without encountering a mismatch or invalid move, it returns `True`.

*** Leetcode Example Question 4 ***
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Here is the Python code:

```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result
```
In this code, we use XOR operation. XOR has a property where A XOR A equals 0. So, if we XOR all numbers together, duplicate numbers will cancel out each other leaving us with the single number.

Please note that this solution works in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `addNegabinary`. This method takes in two lists `arr1` and `arr2` representing the two numbers to be added in base -2. It uses a while loop to iteratively add the digits from right to left (from least significant digit to most significant digit). The modulus operator is used to get the remainder when `total` is divided by 2, which gives the least significant bit of the sum. The floor division operator is used to get the quotient when `total` is divided by -2, which gives the next carry value. If the last digit of the result is zero and the result has more than one digit, this digit is removed. Finally, the reversed result is returned.

```
This solution works by first converting the prices to integers and sorting them in ascending order. Then, it calculates the number of prices that need to be rounded up. The minimum error is then calculated by summing the differences between the rounded prices and the original prices, excluding the highest prices that need to be rounded up. Finally, the error is converted back to a floating point number and formatted as a string with three decimal places.

Please note that this solution assumes that the prices can be rounded down to the nearest integer without causing a loss of precision. If this assumption is not valid, the solution may not work correctly.

```

This solution works by creating a dummy node pointing to the head of the list. Then it iterates over the list to find the last node whose value is not 9. This node is called `notNine`. After incrementing the value of `notNine`, it sets the values of all the following nodes to 0. Finally, it returns the modified list. If the dummy node has a value of 0, then it means that the original number was not all 9s, and we return the modified list without the dummy node. Otherwise, we return the next node of the dummy node.

Leetcode Question:
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
nums is a non-decreasing array.

This Python program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to solve the problem. The BFS starts from the top-left cell (0, 0) and explores all the reachable cells in the grid by moving in all 8 directions. The BFS continues until it reaches the bottom-right cell (n - 1, n - 1), returning the length of the shortest path found. If no path exists, the function returns -1.

```python
class ImmutableListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=None, next=None):

And here is the solution code:

```python

    # base case
    if head.getNext():
        printLinkedListInReverse(head.getNext())
    head.printValue()
```

In this code, we are using recursion to achieve the reversal of the linked list. We start from the end of the linked list (which is the head of the list), then recursively call the function on the next node until we reach the beginning of the list. After reaching the beginning, we print the value of each node. This way, we get the values printed in reverse order.

Please note that this code does not meet the follow-up constraints because it uses a recursive call stack which takes O(n) space where n is the size of the linked list. Also, it does not meet the constant space complexity requirement.

In this Python solution, I used an approach called Inorder Traversal. Inorder traversal of a BST gives a sorted sequence of its elements. So, I just need to calculate the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted sequence.

This function uses a recursive approach where it traverses the tree in an inorder fashion. For every node, it does the following:

1. Recursively visit the left subtree.
2. Update the minimum difference and previous value.
3. Recursively visit the right subtree.

Finally, it returns the minimum difference found during the traversal.

In this Python code, we use a sliding window approach to solve the problem. We initialize two variables, `MOD` and `res`, to handle the modulo operation and store the result respectively. `cur` is used to keep track of the length of the current homogenous substring. 

We iterate over the input string `s`. If the current character is the same as the previous one, we increase `cur` by 1; otherwise, we reset `cur` to 1. Then we add `cur` to `res` and take the modulo of `MOD` to prevent overflow. Finally, we return `res` as the result.

    MOD = 1000000007

This Python code takes a string `s` as input and returns the last substring of `s` in lexicographical order. The function `lastSubstring` first finds all indices where the maximum character occurs in `s`, then forms all substrings ending at these indices, and finally returns the lexicographically maximum substring among these substrings.

This code creates two lists `up` and `lo`, representing the upper and lower rows respectively. Then it iterates over the `colsum` array to fill the `up` and `lo` arrays based on the values in `colsum`. If it's impossible to fulfill the conditions (`upper` or `lower` goes negative), it returns an empty list. Finally, it checks if there are still some `upper` or `lower` to distribute and if so, returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns the constructed matrix as a list of two lists `up` and `lo`.

This solution uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm for generating a random permutation of an array. In the `__init__` method, we store a copy of the original array for resetting later. In the `shuffle` method, we iterate over the array from last to first, for each index `i`, we generate a random index `j` from 0 to `i` (inclusive), then we swap `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. After the iteration, `nums` is a random permutation of the original array.

*** Leetcode Example Question 4 ***

Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of English Uppercase Letters
Here is the solution class:

Please provide Python code for this problem.


*** Leetcode Example Question 5 ***

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Here is the solution class:

```python

    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        pass
```

Please provide Python code for this problem.


*** Leetcode Example Question 6 ***

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Example 1:

ref:
def splitArray(nums, m):
    left, right = max(nums), sum(nums)

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        count, cur_sum = 1, 0
        for num in nums:
            cur_sum += num
            if cur_sum > mid:
                cur_sum = num
                count += 1

```

This Python class defines a method called `closetTarget` which takes three parameters: a list of strings `words`, a string `target`, and an integer `startIndex`. This method returns the minimum number of steps required to reach the target string from the startIndex in the circular array words. If the target string does not exist in words, it returns -1. The approach is to iterate over the words list and calculate the minimum steps required to reach the target string from both sides (clockwise and counter-clockwise). The minimum steps out of these two is the answer. If the target string is not found in words, `float('inf')` is returned as the answer.

This code first counts the frequency of each character in the string using an array of size 26. Then it tries to fit each count into the available frequencies. If a count cannot fit, it increases the result by the difference and tries to fit the next counts.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input string `s` only contains lowercase English letters. If this assumption does not hold, the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.

This code uses the mathematical property that any integer can be expressed as a sum of unique powers of some base `k`. By iterating over possible bases, we can determine the smallest such base.

In the loop, `m` ranges from 2 to `log2(n+1)`. For each `m`, we calculate `k = (n^m)^-1`, then check if `1 + k + ... + k^m` equals `n`. If so, we found a good base. If not, we try the next smaller `m`.

If no suitable base is found, we return `n-1` as a fallback solution.

This Python code solves the problem by defining two helper functions: `check()` and `rotate()`. The `check()` function checks whether `mat` equals `target`. The `rotate()` function rotates `mat` 90 degrees clockwise. The main part of the code performs 4 rotations of `mat` and checks if `mat` equals `target` after each rotation. If `mat` ever equals `target`, the function returns `True`. If `mat` does not equal `target` after 4 rotations, the function returns `False`.

You need to write the body of the function `pseudoPalindromicPaths` inside the class `Solution`.

Here is the solution class:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node, path):
            nonlocal res
            if not node:
                return
            path ^= 1 << node.val
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                if bin(path).count('1') <= 1:
                    res += 1
            else:
                dfs(node.left, path)

        res = 0
        dfs(root, 0)
        return res
```

This code uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree. The variable `path` keeps track of the node values in the current path, and the function `bin(path).count('1')` calculates how many bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of `path`, which corresponds to the count of unique numbers in the current path. If this count is less than or equal to 1, it means that at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome, so we increment `res`.

This Python class uses binary search to solve the problem. It first calculates the total number of elements in the matrix, which is `rows * cols`. Then, it performs a binary search on this range of indices. In each iteration, it calculates the middle index and gets the value at this index in the matrix. If the value is less than the target, it updates the lower boundary to be `mid + 1`. If the value is greater than the target, it updates the higher boundary to be `mid`. If the value equals the target, it returns `True`. If the binary search ends without finding the target, it returns `False`.

This code defines a class Solution with a method combinationSum that takes a list of candidates and a target as inputs and returns a list of lists where each inner list represents a combination of candidates that sums up to the target.

If the target becomes negative, we stop further exploration of this path.

This solution sorts the input intervals by their start times. Then it uses a priority queue (implemented as a heap) to keep track of the earliest ending time of the meetings. For each new meeting, if it starts after the earliest ending time, we can reuse this room; otherwise, we need another room. The size of the heap represents the number of rooms needed.

The time complexity is O(N log N) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(N) for storing the sorted intervals and the heap.

```

This Python solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore each node in the tree. It maintains a count of the labels of the nodes in the current subtree and recursively updates this count when exploring each child node. If the maximum count of labels in the current subtree is greater than in the parent subtree, the parent subtree is counted as a new subtree.

It also marks each node as visited to avoid revisiting nodes. The result is stored in the `res` list. The time complexity is O(n) as each node is visited once, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the adjacency list, the visited list, and the result list.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
You are given an array of integers `arr` of length `n` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum possible value of the sum of a subarray of length `k`. Subarrays are contiguous sequences that occupy part of the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,4,3,7,4,5], k = 3
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** The subarray with maximum sum is [7,4,5] with a sum of 16. However, we can choose [4,3,7] with a sum of 14, which is greater than 16. So, the answer is 15.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [5,2,-1,0,3], k = 3
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The subarray with maximum sum

        return max(max_distance, people[0], len(seats) - 1 - people[-1])
```

Here is how you use this class:

print(solution.maxDistToClosest([1, 0, 0, 0]))  # Output: 3
print(solution.maxDistToClosest([0, 1]))  # Output: 1
```

This solution works by first identifying the indices of all occupied seats. Then it calculates the maximum distance between consecutive occupied seats. Finally, it compares this maximum distance to the distances to the edges of the row (which are always valid answers). The maximum of these three values is the maximum distance to the closest person.

ref:
def maxDistToClosest(seats):
    n = len(seats)
    maxDist = 0
    lastPerson = -1

    for i in range(n):
        if seats[i] == 1:
            if lastPerson == -1:
                maxDist = i
            else:
                maxDist = max(maxDist, (i - lastPerson) // 2)
            lastPerson = i

    maxDist = max(maxDist, n - 1 - lastPerson)
    return maxDist

        return l
```

This code uses binary search to find the minimum possible `x`. The lower bound `l` is `1` and the upper bound `r` is the maximum quantity among all product types. In each iteration of the binary search, we calculate the total number of stores that can be filled with the current `mid` value, and if it is greater than `n`, we increase `l` to `mid + 1`; otherwise, we decrease `r` to `mid`. Finally, we return `l` as the result.

```

This solution sorts the courses by their end dates. It then iterates over the sorted list of courses, adding each course to a priority queue (implemented as a heap) if it fits within the total time available. If a course does not fit, it checks if there is a previously added course with a longer duration that could be replaced by this course. If such a course exists, it is removed from the queue and replaced by this course. Finally, the size of the queue gives the maximum number of courses that can be taken.

```

This solution works by converting the given integer `n` to binary format using the built-in `bin` function. Then it counts the number of ones in the binary representation using the `count` method on the resultant string. If this count is exactly `1`, then `n` is a power of two because powers of two in binary representation always have exactly one '1'. If not, then `n` is not a power of two.

Please note that this solution assumes that `n` is non-negative. If `n` can be negative, additional checks would be needed.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:

        for node in range(len(quiet)):
            dfs(node)
        return res

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to solve the problem. We create a directed graph based on the relationship between people, where edges point from poorer to richer. Then for each person, we start a DFS to find the least quiet person among his/her subordinates (people who are directly or indirectly richer).

The function `dfs` returns the index of the least quiet person in the subtree rooted at `node`. If `res[node]` is already computed, we return it directly. Otherwise, we initialize `res[node]` to `node` and then visit all the children of `node`. If the quietness of the child is smaller than the current minimum, we update `res[node]` to be the result of the child. Finally, we return `res[node]`.

We run `dfs` for each node and return the result.

This Python solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The function `pick_max` picks the maximum number from the list `nums` using `drop` numbers to remove. The function `merge` merges two lists `a` and `b` together by comparing the first element of each list and popping the smaller one. In the main function, we calculate the maximum number from `nums1` and `nums2` using the functions `pick_max` and `merge`. We use list comprehension to generate all possible combinations of picking `i` numbers from `nums1` and `k-i` numbers from `nums2`. Finally, we return the maximum number among all combinations.

*** Leetcode Example Question 4 ***

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

**Input:** [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

**Follow up:**

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Here is the solution class:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
        
        for num in nums[1:]:
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
            
        return max_sum
```

This problem can be solved by using Kadane's Algorithm, which runs in O(n) time complexity. In this algorithm, we maintain a variable `current_sum` which stores the sum of the current subarray, and `max_sum` which stores the maximum sum we have seen so far. We iterate over the array and update `current_sum` and `max_sum` accordingly. If `current_sum` becomes less than the current number, we start a new subarray with the current number.

This is a great example of how understanding the problem and being able to convert it into a computational problem can lead to solutions that are efficient and elegant.

            if seen == wordBag:
                res.append(i)
        return res
```
This python code solves the problem by sliding window approach. We create a counter for each word in words array. Then for each possible starting point in s, we take a substring of size equal to the sum of lengths of all words, and split this substring into chunks of size equal to length of single word. We count how many times each chunk appears in this substring using Counter. If this count matches the original counts of all words, then we found a match. We repeat this process for every possible starting point in s and collect all starting points where such a match is found.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to concatenate words in s, as we start at every possible position and take substring of size equal to the sum of lengths of all words.

Please note that time complexity of this solution is O(m*n), where m is the number of words and n is the length of string s. This is because we need to iterate over all possible starting points in s and for each starting point we take a substring of size equal to the sum of lengths of all words. Space complexity is O(w), where w is the number of distinct words in words array. This is because we store counters for all words in wordBag.

This code calculates the number of substrings ending with 1 in a string. It does this by iterating over the string and increasing a counter whenever it encounters a 1. When it encounters a 0, it adds the sum of all numbers from 1 to the current counter to the result, and then resets the counter. After going through the whole string, it performs the final calculation and returns the result modulo 10^9+7. This is done to prevent overflow and keep the result manageable.

        return dp[-1][-1]
```

This Python solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to maintain a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value we can get by considering the first i events and j events are attended. We sort the events based on their end dates and then for each event, we try to decide whether to attend it or not. If we attend it, we update our dp array accordingly. The bisect function is used to find the next event that can be attended after the current event.

In this code, we iterate over each character in the target string. If the current character is different from the previous one, it means that we need to perform a flip operation, so we increment the `flips` counter and update `prev`. Finally, we return the total number of flip operations.

```
This solution works by creating a dictionary where the keys are the sorted versions of the words (which serve as unique identifiers for anagrams), and the values are lists of words that can be rearranged to form the key. It iterates over each word in the input list, sorts the characters in the word, and checks if this sorted word is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, it appends the original word to the list associated with that key. If it isn't, it creates a new key-value pair in the dictionary with the sorted word as the key and a list containing the original word as the value. Finally, it returns the values from the dictionary as a list of lists.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

*   The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
*   You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false

```python
def wordBreak(s, wordDict):
    dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1) 
    dp[0] = True
    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumBeauty(self, flowers: List[int], newFlowers: int, target: int, full: int, partial: int) -> int:
        from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

        heapify(heap)
        total = sum(flowers)
        while heap and newFlowers >= heap[0] - target + 1:
            remaining = newFlowers - (-heap[0] - target + 1)
            newFlowers = -heap[0] - target + 1
            total += target
            heappush(heap, -remaining)
        return min(total - len(heap) * target, total + full)
```
This Python code uses a heap to keep track of the flowers that need to be replanted. The heap stores the negative values of the flowers because Python's heap implementation does not support negative numbers, and we want to use the maximum heap property to get the minimum number of flowers that need to be replanted. After planting the flowers, the code calculates the total beauty and returns the maximum of the total beauty calculated by considering all flowers as complete and the total beauty calculated by considering the incomplete gardens.

In this Python class, I first convert the list `banned` to a set for faster lookup. Then I iterate over the range from 1 to `n`. For each number `i`, I check if it is not in the `banned` set and if `maxSum` is greater than or equal to `i`. If both conditions are met, I increment the count and subtract `i` from `maxSum`. If `maxSum` becomes less than `i`, I break the loop because we cannot choose more numbers. Finally, I return the count.

Please note that this solution assumes that `banned` contains distinct integers. If `banned` can contain duplicates, you would need to convert it to a set again before checking if a number is banned.

                stack.pop()
                i += 1
        return i == n
```

In the above python code, a binary search tree (BST) is represented as an array. The function `canRepresentBST` checks if the given array can represent a BST.

It starts by creating an empty stack and setting the index `i` to 0. Then it enters a loop where it checks for each value in the array if it should go on the stack or not. If the current value is less than the last value in the stack, it should go on the stack. This means that this value is the root of a subtree, and the last value in the stack is the parent of this node. If the current value is greater than the last value in the stack, it means that the current value should be the right child of the last value in the stack. Therefore, it pops the last value from the stack and increases the index `i`. After the loop, if `i` equals `n`, it means that all values have been processed and the array represents a BST. Otherwise, it does not represent a BST.

            n = get_next(n)

        return n == 1
```
This solution works by defining a helper function `get_next(n)`, which calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of a number `n`. Then, in the main function, we use a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. We iterate until either `n` becomes 1 (which means `n` is a happy number), or `n` has been seen before (which means we are in a cycle and `n` is not a happy number). In the latter case, we return `False`. Otherwise, we return `True`.

This Python code uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse both the original and cloned trees simultaneously. It maintains two stacks, one for each tree, to keep track of the nodes to visit. If the current node in the original tree matches the target node, it immediately returns the corresponding node in the cloned tree. Otherwise, it adds the children of the current nodes to the stacks for both trees. This process continues until the stacks are empty, indicating that the target node has been found or the trees have been fully traversed. If the target node cannot be found, it returns `None`.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. An operation consists of choosing any two adjacent and non-equal characters and swapping them.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make every instance of the sequence `"abc"` occur at least once in `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "baacbbcaabcccacb"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Here are the results of three operations:
- Swap the first and second characters of the string, resulting in "aabbbccaaccbc".
- Swap the third and fourth characters of the string, resulting in "aabccbaacbcbc".
- Swap the sixth and seventh characters of the string, resulting in "aabccbaacbcbc".
Now, every instance of "abc" is found.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aabbcc"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** All instances of "abc" are already present in s.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "cababc"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Here are the results of two operations:
- Swap the first and third characters of the string, resulting in "abcabc".
- Swap the third and sixth characters of the string, resulting in "abcbaac".
Now, every instance of "abc" is found.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

In this solution, we start by assuming that we can reach any number from `1` to `missing - 1`. We then try to extend this range by adding numbers from `nums`. If `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `missing`, we can reach `missing + nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is greater than `missing`, we cannot reach `missing` directly, so we need to add a number to the array to reach `missing`. This is done by multiplying `missing` by `2` and incrementing `added` by `1`. The process continues until we can reach any number from `1` to `n`.

                a -= (b << x)
        return res if (dividend > 0) == (divisor > 0) else -res
```
This solution works by shifting the bits of the dividend and divisor to the left by 31, 30, ..., 0 bits respectively, and subtracting the divisor from the dividend as many times as possible. This is equivalent to repeatedly doubling the divisor and halving the dividend, and counting how many times the divisor can fit into the dividend. The time complexity of this solution is O(logN), where N is the dividend.

    if dividend == -(2**31) and divisor == -1:
        return 2**31 - 1

    sign = -1 if (dividend > 0) ^ (divisor > 0) else 1

    dvd = abs(dividend)
    dvs = abs(divisor)
    ans = 0

    while dvd >= dvs:
        temp = dvs
        multiple = 1
        while dvd >= (temp << 1):
            temp <<= 1
            multiple <<= 1
        dvd -= temp
        ans += multiple

This solution uses backtracking to solve the problem. The `splitString` function iterates over all possible splits of the string `s` into two parts, and for each valid split, it calls the `dfs` function to check if the rest of the string can be split into substrings with a decreasing value and a difference of 1. The `dfs` function implements the backtracking part of the solution. It checks all possible splits of the remaining string into substrings with a decreasing value and a difference of 1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because in the worst case scenario, we have to iterate over all possible splits of the string and for each split, we have to iterate over all possible substrings. The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack used in the `dfs` function. In the worst case scenario, the depth of the recursion stack could be n.

This code uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars in the histogram. For each bar, it calculates the maximum area that can be obtained by considering this bar as the smallest bar in a rectangle. This is done by popping elements from the stack and calculating the area for each popped bar. The index of the last popped bar is used as the width of the rectangle. The current index is used as the right boundary of the rectangle. The maximum area found so far is updated whenever a larger area is calculated.

You need to implement the `bestClosingTime` method in this class to solve the problem.

Here is a sample test case:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.bestClosingTime("YYNY")) # should print 2
```
Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def bestClosingTime(self, customers: str) -> int:
        n = len(customers)
        no_of_y = customers.count('Y')
        no_of_n = n - no_of_y
        min_penalty = float('inf')
        earliest_hour = -1
        cur_penalty = no_of_y
        for i in range(n):
            if customers[i] == 'Y':
                cur_penalty -= 1
            else:
                cur_penalty += 1
            if cur_penalty < min_penalty:
                min_penalty = cur_penalty
                earliest_hour = i + 1
        return earliest_hour
```
In the above solution, we start by counting the total number of 'Y' and 'N' in the string. Then we initialize the minimum penalty and the earliest hour. We then iterate over the string and update our current penalty accordingly. If the current penalty is less than our minimum penalty, we update our minimum penalty and store the current hour as the earliest hour. Finally, we return the earliest hour.

Testing the solution:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.bestClosingTime("YYNY")) # should print 2
```
This will output 2 which is correct.

def min_penalty(customers: str) -> int:
    n = len(customers)

            open_penalty += 1
        else:
            closed_penalty += 1

    result = closed_penalty
    penalty = closed_penalty

    for c in customers:
        if c == 'N':
            penalty -= 1
        else:
            penalty += 1

        result = min(result, penalty)

This Python code defines a function `area()` that calculates the area of a triangle given three points, and another function `largestTriangleArea()` that uses this helper function to calculate the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three points in the given list of points. This is done by iterating over all possible combinations of three points and updating the maximum area found so far. The result is then returned.

This solution starts at the top-right corner of the matrix (first column last row) and moves downwards or leftwards depending on whether the current cell has a `1` or a `0`. This way, it always considers the next best possible cell to potentially have a `1`, reducing the search space by one row or one column after each step. If it reaches a cell with a `1`, it updates the column index and continues this process until it has checked all rows. Finally, it checks if the column index was updated, meaning it found a `1` in the matrix, and returns it; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

If it can, then those orders are removed from the heap and the remaining amount is processed for the next order. If

This solution uses the concept of divide and conquer to sort the linked list. It splits the list into two halves, sorts them separately and then merges them. The merge function is used to merge two sorted lists. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because it divides the list into two halves in every recursive call and takes linear time to merge two halves.

This class contains a method named `rotate` which takes a 2D list `matrix` as an argument. The method first reverses the matrix (which rotates it by 180 degrees) and then transposes it (which rotates it by 90 degrees clockwise). The result is a rotated matrix.

Note: This is a very efficient solution because it does not use any additional memory and operates in O(1) space complexity, as required. However, it does use O(n^2) time complexity, as it needs to access every element in the matrix once.

In this solution, we use dynamic programming. We create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within the substring `s[i:j+1]`. We fill this table in a bottom-up manner. If `s[i]` equals `s[j]`, then the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within `s[i:j+1]` is 2 plus the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within `s[i+1:j]`. If `s[i]` does not equal `s[j]`, then the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within `s[i:j+1]` is the maximum of the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequences within `s[i+1:j]` and `s[i:j-1]`. Finally, we return `dp[0][-1]` which represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within the entire string `s`.

This code defines a class Solution with a method makeStringSorted. The method takes a string s as input and returns the number of operations needed to sort the string. The solution uses dynamic programming to calculate factorials and modular multiplicative inverses, and counts the occurrences of each character in the string. Then it calculates the number of permutations of the remaining part of the string, and subtracts this number from the total number of permutations to get the number of operations needed.

*** Leetcode Example Question 3 ***
Given a string `s`, return _the sum of beauty of all substrings_.

The beauty of a string is defined as the difference between the maximum frequency and minimum frequency of characters in the string.

For example, the beauty of string "aaacbb" is `3 - 1 = 2`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aabcb"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","b","c","cb","b"], their beauties are [2,1,1,1,1], so the sum of beauty is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aabcbaa"
**Output:** 12

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
**Code solution:** 

```python
from collections import defaultdict

            freq_map[s[i]] += 1
            
        total_sum += width - 1 - max(freq_map.values())

        if blocks[j] == 'W':

Note: In this code, we use a priority queue (heap) to keep track of the maximum quality among the K workers we have hired so far. This allows us to quickly determine the total quality cost if we need to fire a worker who has the highest quality. The variable `res` stores the smallest possible total wage that can be paid to meet the requirements.

This Python class contains a method named `shortestDistance` which accepts a grid as input. The grid is a 2D list of integers representing the layout of the city. The function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to calculate the minimum total distance from all buildings to an empty land cell. It then returns the minimum total distance or `-1` if it's impossible.

The `BFS` function takes the coordinates of a building as input and performs BFS starting from this building. During BFS,

```
This Python program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. We start by initializing a 3D array dp where dp[i][j][k] represents the probability that the knight is at cell (i, j) after i steps and is still within the board. Then, we iterate over each step from k to 0, and for each step, update the probabilities of each cell on the board. Finally, we return the probability of the knight being at cell (row, column) after k steps.

Please note that this program assumes that the size of the board n is less than or equal to 25 because the maximum value of n in the problem constraints is 25. If you try to use this program with a larger board size, you may encounter memory errors due to the large amount of memory required by the 3D array.

In this Python code, we use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree. We pass two nodes, `node1` and `node2`, at the same level of the tree. If the level is odd, we swap the values of `node1` and `node2`. After DFS finishes, we return the modified root of the tree. This solution assumes that the left child of a node is the right sibling of its parent, and vice versa.

```

This code uses a dictionary to maintain the history of values for each index. The keys in the dictionary are snap_ids and the values are the corresponding values at those snap_ids. When setting a value, it's simply added to the current snap_id. When taking a snapshot, the snap_id is incremented and the previous snap_id is returned. When getting a value, it iterates backwards from the requested snap_id to find the highest snap_id where the value exists.

Note: This code assumes that the `set` function will never be called with an index that doesn't exist in the array, and that the `get` function will always be called with a valid snap_id.

This Python code solves the problem by first building an adjacency list where each node points to the three nodes with highest scores it is connected to. Then it iterates over all pairs of nodes and checks if they can form a valid node sequence of length 4. If they can, it updates the maximum score. Finally, it returns the maximum score or -1 if no valid node sequence of length 4 exists.

I want you to provide the Python code without explaining anything. Here is the solution:

```python

    def kMirror(self, k: int, n: int) -> int:
        def is_palindrome(num: str, base: int) -> bool:
            return num == num[::-1]

        def to_base(num: int, base: int) -> str:
            if num == 0:
                return '0'
            digits = []
            while num:
                digits.append(str(num % base))
                num //= base
            return ''.join(digits[::-1])

        count, total, num = 0, 0, 1
        while count < n:
            if is_palindrome(to_base(num, k), k) and is_palindrome(to_base(num, 10), 10):
                total += num
                count += 1
            num += 1
        return total
```

This solution works by checking every number if it is a palindrome in base 10 and base k. If it is, it adds the number to the total and increments the count. The process continues until the count reaches n.

ref:
def minWastedSpace(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)

        return sum(count_divisors_and_sum(n)[1] for n in nums)
```

This solution works by iterating over each number in the input list, and for each number, it checks the divisors of that number. If the number has exactly four divisors, it adds the sum of these divisors to the total sum. This is done using a helper function `count_divisors_and_sum`, which returns the count of divisors and their sum for a given number `n`.

If `n` has more than four divisors, this function returns `(0, 0)`, which indicates that `n` does not have exactly four divisors.

Finally, the main function returns the total sum of the sums of divisors for all numbers in the input list.

ref:
def sum_of_four_divisors(nums):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        count = 0

                count += 1 if i * i == num else 2
                div_sum += i + (num // i)
                if count > 4:
                    break
            i += 1

*** Leetcode Example Question 4 ***
You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represents the start and end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an integer `newInterval` = [`start`, `end`] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
**Output:** [[1,5],[6,9]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
**Output:** [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
**Explanation:** Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 105`
*   `intervals` is sorted by `starti` in ascending order.
*   `newInterval.length == 2`
*   `0 <= start <= end <= 105`
**Code solution:**

        for a, b in queries:

            while a != 1:
                a /= 2
                depth_a += 1
            while b != 1:
                b /= 2
                depth_b += 1
            while depth_a > depth_b:
                a /= 2
                depth_a -= 1

                b /= 2

                depth_b += 1
            res.append(depth_a + 1)
        return res
```

This code calculates the depth of both nodes `a` and `b` from the root, then aligns their depths by dividing the deeper node by 2 until they have the same depth. Then, it counts the common ancestor node by continuously dividing both nodes by 2 and increasing the count until they meet. Finally, it adds 1 to the count (for the root node) to get the cycle length and appends it to the result list.

In this solution, we use a dictionary to keep track of the last timestamp for each unique message. When a new message comes in, we check whether the current timestamp minus the last timestamp is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, we update the last timestamp and return True; otherwise, we return False.

This way, for each unique message, we ensure that it can only be printed at most every 10 seconds.

This code defines a class `Solution` with an initialization method `__init__` and a picking method `pick`. In the constructor, it creates a mapping from the non-blacklisted numbers to the corresponding non-blacklisted number (or itself if it is a non-blacklisted number) and stores this mapping in the `map` attribute. When `pick` is called, it generates a random number in the range of non-blacklisted numbers, checks if this number is mapped, and returns the mapped value if it exists, otherwise it just returns the generated number.

This way, each number has an equal chance to be picked, and all blacklisted numbers are excluded. The time complexity of the constructor is O(N) where N is the size of the blacklist, and the time complexity of the `pick` method is O(1).

This solution works by first creating an adjacency list representation of the graph. Then it performs depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to find connected components. For each connected component, it calculates the number of pairs that can be formed and adds them to the result. Finally, it returns the total number of pairs.

This solution uses a sliding window approach. The variable `anchor` is used to mark the start of the current subarray, and `res` is used to keep track of the maximum length of turbulent subarray. The function `comp` is used to compare two numbers and return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the first number is less than, equal to, or greater than the second number. In the main part of the function, we iterate over the array, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers using `comp`. If the pair has the same comparison result, we reset the anchor to the current index. If the pair has different comparison result or it's the last pair in the array, we update `res` and reset the anchor to the next index. Finally, we return `res` as the result.

```
This python program uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree. It starts from the root and keeps going down to the leaf nodes. When reaching a leaf node, it adds the path to the result list. The path is updated in place because strings in Python are immutable.

Then it goes back to the previous node and continues this process until all nodes have been visited. The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, because each node is visited exactly once. The space complexity is O(N), because in the worst case, the maximum depth of the recursion is N (unbalanced tree), and the space used by the system call stack is proportional to the maximum depth of the recursion.

class Solution:
    def equalSubstring(self, s: str, t: str, maxCost: int) -> int:
        # Your code here
```

You should write your code inside the `equalSubstring` method.

Here is how you can solve this problem:

1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` at the start of the string `s`.
2. Also initialize a variable `cost` to keep track of the total cost.
3. While `right` pointer is within the bounds of the string `s`, do the following:
   - Calculate the cost required to change the `right`th character of `s` to the `right`th character of `t`.
   - If the calculated cost is less than or equal to `maxCost`, increment `cost` by the calculated cost.
   - If the calculated cost is greater than `maxCost`, move the `left` pointer to the right and subtract the cost of changing the `left`th character of `s` to the `left`th character of `t` from `cost`.
   - Keep track of the maximum length of the substring that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.
4. Return the maximum length.

Here is the Python code for the above approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def equalSubstring(self, s: str, t: str, maxCost: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        cost = 0
        max_length = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            diff = abs(ord(s[right]) - ord(t[right]))
            
            if diff + cost > maxCost:
                max_length = max(max_length, right - left)
                
                while diff + cost > maxCost:
                    cost -= abs(ord(s[left]) - ord(t[left]))
                    left += 1
                    
            cost += diff
            
        max_length = max(max_length, len(s) - left)
        
        return max_length
```

This ensures that `res` remains positive and large enough to make the total never less than 1.

This Python class defines a method named `longestPalindrome` which takes two strings `word1` and `word2` as arguments. This method uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The variable `dp` is a 2D array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum length of the palindrome that can be obtained by concatenating non-empty subsequences from `word1[i:]` and `word2[j:]`. The `for` loops fill the `dp` table in reverse order, starting from the last row and column. The innermost `if` statement checks whether the characters in `word1` and `word2` at index `i` and `j` match. If they do, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i+1][j+1]+1`, which means that the palindrome length increases by 1. If they don't match, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i+1][j]` and `dp[i][j+1]`, which means the palindrome length remains the same. Finally, the method returns the maximum value in the first row of the `dp` table.

```
This Python class provides a method named `matrixScore` which calculates the highest possible score after making any number of moves. The approach used here is based on greedy algorithms. We start by flipping rows so that the most significant bit is 1. Then, we iteratively analyze each bit from the second most significant bit to the least significant bit. If there are more 0's in this column than 1's, we flip this column. This ensures that the sum of the columns (which correspond to the binary numbers) is maximized.
*** Leetcode Example Question 4 ***
You are given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `x`. Your task is to find the `k` integers that are closest to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there are multiple answers, choose the smallest among them.

```
This Python class defines a method called `findMinArrowShots` that takes a list of lists of integers `points` as input. It sorts the list of points based on the end coordinate of each point. Then it iterates over the sorted list, incrementing the count whenever it encounters a point whose start coordinate is greater than the current end coordinate. This is because this means that we need a new arrow to burst all balloons in this interval. Finally, it returns the count of arrows needed.

ref:
def findMinArrowShots(points):
    if not points:
        return 0

In this code, we generate all possible times (up to 24*60), sorting them and comparing them with the sorted version of the input array. If they match, we return the time in the required format. If no match is found after checking all times, we return an empty string.

Please note that this code assumes that the input array contains distinct integers. If the input array may contain duplicate integers, you would need to modify the code to handle this case.

```
This Python code defines a class named `Solution` which has a method called `insertIntoBST`. This method takes a `TreeNode` object `root` and an integer `val` as arguments. If `root` is `None`, it means that the tree is currently empty, so a new `TreeNode` object with the value `val` is created and returned. If `val` is less than the value of `root`, the function is recursively called on the left subtree of `root`. If `val` is greater than or equal to the value of `root`, the function is recursively called on the right subtree of `root`. The function finally returns the `root` after the insertion.

class Solution:
    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:

```
Please replace this placeholder text with the Python code you would use to solve this problem.

Here is the solution class:

```python
class Solution:
    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:
        for b in range(2, n - 2 + 1):
            s = ''
            while n:
                s += str(n % b)
                n //= b
            if s != s[::-1]:
                return False
        return True
```

This solution works by converting `n` to each base from 2 to `n - 2 + 1`, and checking if the resulting string is a palindrome. If it is not, the function immediately returns `False`. If it is, the function continues to the next base. If the function has checked all bases and hasn't returned `False`, then `n` must be strictly palindromic, so it returns `True`.

ref:
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

    s = []
    while n > 0:
        s.append(str(n % base))
        n //= base
    return "".join(reversed(s))

def is_strictly_palindromic(n: int) -> bool:
    for b in range(2, n - 1):
        if not is_palindrome(to_base_str(n, b)):
            return False
    return True

        return idx
```
This code uses a queue to temporarily store the characters read by `read4` when there are less than 4 characters left in the file. When `read` is called, it retrieves characters from the queue and updates the buffer.

This code assumes that the `read4` function is provided by the system and does not need to be implemented. The `read4` function reads four characters from the file and returns the number of characters read.
