## Solution

This problem can be solved by using a simple merge process of two sorted linked lists. We start from the head of both linked lists, and choose the larger power node to append to our result list. If the powers are equal, we add the coefficients and append the resultant node to our result list.

We continue this process until one of the linked lists ends, and then we append the remaining nodes of the other list to our result list.

Here is Python code that implements the above approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def addPoly(self, poly1: 'PolyNode', poly2: 'PolyNode') -> 'PolyNode':
        dummy = PolyNode()
        curr = dummy
        while poly1 and poly2:
            if poly1.power > poly2.power:
                curr.next = poly1
                poly1 = poly1.next
            elif poly1.power < poly2.power:
                curr.next = poly2
                poly2 = poly2.next
            else:
                val = poly1.coefficient + poly2.coefficient
                if val != 0:
                    curr.next = PolyNode(val, poly1.power)
                    curr = curr.next
                poly1 = poly1.next
                poly2 = poly2.next
            curr = curr.next
        if poly1:
            curr.next = poly1
        if poly2:
            curr.next = poly2
        return dummy.next
```

In this code, we create a dummy node before the resultant linked list. This helps us to avoid checking whether the resultant linked list is empty or not. After the addition, we link the rest of the longer linked list to the resultant list. Finally, we return the next node of the dummy node which will be the head of the resultant linked list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the maximum length of the two input linked lists. The space complexity is also O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Note: The class definition for `PolyNode` is as follows:


ref:
class PolyNode:
    def __init__(self, c: int, p: int, next: 'PolyNode' = None):
        self.coefficient = c
        self.power = p
        self.next = next

def addPoly(poly1: PolyNode, poly2: PolyNode) -> PolyNode:
    dummy = PolyNode(0, 0)
    current = dummy

    while poly1 and poly2:
        if poly1.power > poly2.power:
            current.next = poly1
            poly1 = poly1.next
        elif poly1.power < poly2.power:
            current.next = poly2
            poly2 = poly2.next
        else:
            sum = poly1.coefficient + poly2.coefficient
            if sum != 0:
                current.next = PolyNode(sum, poly1.power)
                current = current.next
            poly1 = poly1.next
            poly2 = poly2.next
        current = current.next

    current.next = poly1 if poly1 else poly2
    return dummy.next

Solution:
The approach to solve this problem is to use two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of the input string. Then we calculate the beauty of each substring by using a frequency map and finding the difference between the maximum and minimum frequency. Finally, we add up all the beauties to get the final result.

Here is a Python solution:

```python
def beautySum(s: str) -> int:
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        freq = [0] * 26
        max_freq = 0
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            freq[ord(s[j]) - ord('a')] += 1
            max_freq = max(max_freq, max(freq))
            if max_freq > 0:
                res += max_freq - min(freq)
    return res
```

In this solution, we initialize a frequency array `freq` of size 26 (for 26 lowercase English letters) and a variable `max_freq` to keep track of the maximum frequency of characters in the current substring. We then iterate over the string from index `i` to `j`, updating the frequency of characters and `max_freq` as we go along. If `max_freq` is greater than 0 (meaning there is at least one character in the current substring), we add the difference between `max_freq` and the minimum frequency to our result. This gives us the beauty of the current substring. We repeat this process for all substrings of `s` and finally return the sum of their beauties.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because we have two nested loops that run over the string. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the frequency array and variables.

Solution:
```python
from collections import Counter
import operator
def frequencySort(nums):
    count = Counter(nums)
    nums.sort(key=lambda x: (count[x], -x))
    return nums
```
In this solution, we first use `collections.Counter` to get the frequency of each number in the input list `nums`. Then, we sort the list `nums` based on two criteria: the frequency of the numbers (using `count[x]` as key), and the negative value of the numbers (so that numbers with higher frequencies but smaller absolute values come first). The `-x` ensures that numbers with equal frequencies are sorted in decreasing order.

The time complexity is O(n log n) because we need to sort the list, where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the counter dictionary and the sorted list.

Test the function:
```python
print(frequencySort([1,1,2,2,2,3])) # [3,1,1,2,2,2]
print(frequencySort([2,3,1,3,2])) # [1,3,3,2,2]
print(frequencySort([-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1])) # [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
```

Solution:
The problem can be solved by iterating over the operations and incrementing each cell in the matrix that corresponds to the operation. Then, we simply return the maximum value in the matrix as the result.

Python Solution:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxCount(self, m, n, ops):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :type ops: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Initialize the matrix with zeros
        mat = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Increment each cell corresponding to each operation
        for op in ops:
            a, b = op
            for i in range(a):
                for j in range(b):
                    mat[i][j] += 1
        
        # Return the maximum value in the matrix
        return max(map(max, mat))
```
This solution works by first initializing a `m x n` matrix filled with zeros. It then iterates over each operation, incrementing each cell in the matrix that corresponds to the operation. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the matrix as the result. This is done using Python's built-in `max()` function combined with the `map()` function to find the maximum value in each row of the matrix.

This solution has a time complexity of O(mn) because in the worst case, we have to visit every cell in the matrix. The space complexity is also O(mn) for storing the matrix.

However, this solution can be optimized by realizing that we only need to keep track of the maximum value in each column and each row. We can do this by iterating over each operation and keeping track of the maximum values in each row and column separately. After processing all operations, the maximum value in the matrix will be the minimum of the maximum values in all rows and columns. This reduces the space complexity to O(m+n), which is much more efficient when m and n are large.

Here is the optimized Python solution:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxCount(self, m, n, ops):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int

ref:
def maxCount(m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for op in ops:
        m = min(m, op[0])
        n = min(n, op[1])
    return m * n

Solution:
This problem can be solved by using graph coloring algorithm. We can treat each person as a node and each pair of dislikes as an edge between two nodes. Then we use two colors to color the nodes in the graph, with one color representing one group and the other color representing the other group. If we can successfully color the graph with two colors, then we can split everyone into two groups. If we cannot, then we cannot split everyone into two groups.

Here is a Python solution:

```python
def possibleBipartition(n, dislikes):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    colors = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    for u, v in dislikes:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
        
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if colors[i] == 0 and not dfs(graph, colors, i, 1):
            return False
            
    return True

def dfs(graph, colors, node, color):
    colors[node] = color
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if colors[neighbor] == color:
            return False
        if colors[neighbor] == 0 and not dfs(graph, colors, neighbor, -color):
            return False
    return True
```

In this solution, we first build the graph represented by adjacency list and then apply depth-first search (DFS) on each unvisited node. If we find a conflict (i.e., a node which is colored the same as its neighbor), we return False. If no conflict is found after DFS, we return True. If there exists a node that cannot be colored due to conflicts, we return False. Otherwise, we return True.

The time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges. The space complexity is O(n + m), also for storing the graph.

This solution works because it uses graph coloring to solve the problem. The key idea is to assign different colors to the nodes in the graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If it's possible to do so, then it's possible to split the

Solution:
This problem can be solved by using a set in Python. We will add each character from the input string to the set. At the end of this process, if the length of the set is 26 (which represents all the letters of the English alphabet), then the input string is a pangram and we return True, otherwise we return False.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
def checkIfPangram(sentence):
    return len(set(sentence)) == 26
```

This function works by converting the input string into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate characters. The size of the set will be equal to the number of unique characters in the string, so if there are 26 unique characters (all the letters of the English alphabet), then the string must be a pangram.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we traverse the entire input string once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case scenario (when all characters in the input string are unique), the size of the set would be equal to the length of the string.

Testing:

```python
print(checkIfPangram("thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog")) # Expected output: True
print(checkIfPangram("leetcode")) # Expected output: False
```

This solution should pass all test cases.

Note: This solution assumes that the input string only contains lowercase English letters and spaces. If there could be uppercase letters or other special characters in the string, additional error checking would be needed.

Also note that this solution assumes that the string is not empty. If it could be possible for an empty string to be passed in as input, you would need to add a special case to handle this.

Solution:
The problem can be solved by using two pointers and keeping track of the maximum length of the subarray. The idea is to keep track of the last occurrence of zeros and ones in the given array. When we encounter a zero, we remove the previous longest subarray and update the start of our subarray as the next element after the last occurrence of one. If there are no zeros in the array, we just move the end pointer forward until we encounter a zero.

Here is a Python solution:
```python
def longestSubarray(nums):
    start = end = 0
    zero_index = -1 # index of last occurrence of zero
    max_len = 0
    
    while end < len(nums):
        if nums[end] == 0:
            start = zero_index + 1 # start new subarray after last occurrence of zero
            zero_index = end # update the index of last occurrence of zero
        max_len = max(max_len, end - start)
        end += 1
        
    return max_len if max_len == len(nums) else max_len + 1 # subtract one if all elements are 1
```

This solution runs in O(n) time where n is the length of the input list. It uses O(1) extra space.

Note: This solution assumes that you are allowed to delete at most one element from the array. If you can delete more than one element, then you need to modify the solution accordingly.

        if neighbor != parent:

Solution:
This problem can be solved by using priority queue and greedy algorithm. We start from the most frequent element, and try to put it as far as possible in the result array. After we used the most frequent element, we decrease its count and add it back to the priority queue. If the next most frequent element is also the same as the previous one, we need to remove it from the priority queue because it will not be able to be put into the result array.

Here is the python code for this problem:

```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def rearrangeBarcodes(barcodes):
    cnt = Counter(barcodes)
    max_heap = []
    for key, value in cnt.items():
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-value, key))
        
    res = []
    while len(max_heap) > 1:
        v1, k1 = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        v2, k2 = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        res.extend([k1, k2])
        if v1 < -1:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (v1+1, k1))
        if v2 < -1:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (v2+1, k2))
            
    # if there is only one item left
    if max_heap:
        res.append(max_heap[0][1])
    
    return res
```
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) which is due to the usage of heap. The space complexity is O(n).

The logic here is that, since we want to make sure that no two adjacent barcodes are the same, we should always choose the barcode with the highest frequency. So, we use a max heap to keep track of the barcode with the highest frequency. For each step, we pop out the barcode with the highest frequency and append it to our result list. Then, we push the remaining barcode back to the max heap. This way, we ensure that no two adjacent barcodes are the same

Solution:
This problem can be solved by using backtracking algorithm.

In Python, the main idea is to loop through all possible positions to split the string into two parts and then check if they are valid numbers. If both parts are valid, we recursively check the rest part. If the rest part is also valid, return True. Otherwise, continue the loop.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def isAdditiveNumber(self, num: str) -> bool:
        def isValid(i, j, k):
            s = num[i:j]
            t = num[j:k]
            if len(s) > 1 and s[0] == '0' or len(t) > 1 and t[0] == '0':
                return False
            x = int(s) + int(t)
            y = num[k:k+len(str(x))]
            return x == int(y) and len(x) == len(y)

        n = len(num)
        for i in range(1, n//2+1):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if isValid(0, i, j):
                    return True
        return False
```

For the follow-up question, if the input integers are extremely large, we need to use big integer library like BigInteger in Java or use arbitrary precision arithmetic in Python. This allows us to handle integers with hundreds of digits.

Time complexity is O(N^3) because there are three nested loops and space complexity is O(N) because of the recursion stack.

Note: Be careful about the corner cases. For example, when the number starts with '0', it should not be treated as a valid number. In the function `isValid`, we should prevent adding '0' at the beginning of the number.

Also, pay attention to the index in slicing operation. The end index is exclusive, so we need to add one to the second parameter to get the character at the end.

Finally, note that the time complexity could be reduced to O(N^2) by using dynamic programming. However, it will increase the space complexity to O(N^2). Therefore, this solution has been

Solution:
The problem can be solved by using an iterative in-order traversal with a stack data structure. In the process, we flatten the left subtree of each node to its rightmost node, and make the right child of this rightmost node as the parent's new right child. This way, we are essentially performing an in-order traversal but modifying the tree at the same time.

Here is the Python code:

```python
class Solution:
    def increasingBST(self, root):
        dummy = TreeNode(0) # create a dummy node
        prev = dummy
        stack = []
        
        while True:
            while root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            if not stack:
                return dummy.right
            node = stack.pop()
            root = node.right
            
            # modify the tree
            node.left = None
            prev.right, prev = node, node
```

In this code, `dummy` is a placeholder node which acts as the head of the resultant list. `prev` keeps track of the last processed node (which would be the last node in the in-order traversal). The while loop runs until the stack is empty and all nodes have been processed. In each iteration, we push the current node onto the stack and move to its left child. If there is no left child, we pop the top node from the stack, process it (make it the right child of the previous node), and then move to its right child.

Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.

Space complexity: O(N), where N is the height of the tree. In the worst case scenario (when the tree is skewed), the stack would contain all nodes.

This solution follows the constraints of the problem and solves it in linear time.

This problem belongs to the category of Binary Trees. It is typically solved using recursion or iteratively using stack data structure. The problem is about understanding how to manipulate binary trees and how to handle edge cases.

I hope you find this explanation helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.

Solution:
This problem can be solved by using the concept of bit manipulation and counting sorting.

The idea is to count the frequency of each digit in the number, then check if the number of digits with odd counts is less than or equal to 1. If it is, then return True because it's possible to rearrange the digits to form a power of 2.

Here is the Python code for the above approach:

```python
def reorderedPowerOf2(n):
    def countDigits(n):
        return [0]*10
    return sorted(str(n)) in [sorted(str(1<<i)) for i in range(31)]
```
In the above code, `countDigits(n)` function counts the frequency of each digit in the number `n` and returns a list of 10 zeros. Then, we generate all possible powers of 2 from 0 to 30 and convert them into strings, sort them, and compare with the sorted version of `n`. If they match, we return True; otherwise, we return False.

Time complexity of this solution is O(logN), where N is the input number. The space complexity is also O(logN).

Please note that the `1<<i` operation is used to get the power of 2 for the value of i.

Also, this solution assumes that the number of digits in the input number does not exceed 10. This is because in base 10, the maximum number is 10^9 which has 10 digits.

Lastly, this solution works under the assumption that the number of digits in the input number does not exceed 10. This is because in base 10, the maximum number is 10^9 which has 10 digits.

Please note that this solution might not work as expected for very large numbers due to limitations in the precision of floating point arithmetic in Python.

Solution:
This problem can be solved by using a sliding window approach with two pointers. We start with a left pointer at the beginning of the string s and a right pointer at the beginning of s as well. We then move our right pointer until we have included all characters in string t in our current window. When we have included all characters in t, we then try to minimize our window by moving our left pointer to the right. If the character at the new left pointer is not in t, we keep moving it to the right. We repeat this process until our right pointer reaches the end of the string s.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
from collections import Counter
def minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    if not t or not s:
        return ""

    dict_t = Counter(t)
    required = len(dict_t)

    l, r = 0, 0
    formed = 0
    window_counts = {}

    ans = float("inf"), None, None

    while r < len(s):
        character = s[r]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

        if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:
            formed += 1

        while l <= r and formed == required:
            character = s[l]

            if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:
                ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)

            window_counts[character] -= 1
            if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:
                formed -= 1

            l += 1    

        r += 1    

    return "" if ans[0] == float("inf") else s[ans[1] : ans[2] + 1]
```

In the above solution, we use a Counter object `dict_t` to count the frequency of each character in string t. We also keep track of how many unique characters in t are already included in the current window with the variable `formed`.

We move our right pointer `r
ref:
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s, t):
    need = Counter(t)
    window = {}
    
    left = 0
    right = 0
    valid = 0
    start = 0
    length = float('inf')

    while right < len(s):
        c = s[right]
        right += 1
        if c in need:
            window[c] = window.get(c, 0) + 1
            if window[c] <= need[c]:
                valid += 1

        while valid == len(t):
            if right - left < length:
                start = left
                length = right - left

            d = s[left]
            left += 1

                    valid -= 1

Solution:
---------

The problem is asking to find the minimum number of swaps required to make two strings similar. The approach to solve this problem is to use BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between two states of the string. 

Here's the Python code for the above approach:

```python
from collections import deque
def kSimilarity(s1, s2):
    queue = deque([(s1, 0)])
    visited = {s1: 0}
    while queue:
        curr, step = queue.popleft()
        if curr == s2:
            return step
        for nxt in neighbors(curr, s2):
            if nxt not in visited:
                visited[nxt] = step + 1
                queue.append((nxt, step + 1))

def neighbors(curr, s2):
    lst = list(curr)
    for i in range(len(curr)):
        if lst[i] != s2[i]:
            for j in range(i+1, len(curr)):
                if lst[j] == s2[i] and lst[j] != s2[j]:
                    lst[i], lst[j] = lst[j], lst[i]
                    yield "".join(lst)
                    lst[i], lst[j] = lst[j], lst[i]

print(kSimilarity("ab", "ba"))  # Output: 1
print(kSimilarity("abc", "bca"))  # Output: 2
```

In the above python program, firstly, a BFS is performed using a queue. For each state, it generates all possible next states by swapping characters in the current string until they match with corresponding characters in the target string. It keeps track of the steps taken to reach the current state. If the current state is equal to the target string, it returns the steps taken. Otherwise, it continues to explore other possible states.

This solution has time complexity O(n!) since in the worst case scenario, there are n factorial permutations of the string.
Space complexity is also O(n!) due to the
ref:
def kSimilarity(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    k = 0
    temp = list(s1)

    for i in range(len(temp)):
        if temp[i] != s2[i]:
            j = i + 1
            while temp[j] != s2[i] or s2[j] == temp[j]:
                j += 1
            temp[i], temp[j] = temp[j], temp[i]
            k += 1

Solution:
The problem can be solved by using Depth First Search (DFS) and dynamic programming.

Here is the Python code for it:
```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def maxNumEdgesToRemove(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        parent = list(range(n+1))
        
        def find(x):
            if x != parent[x]:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])
            return parent[x]
        
        def union(xy):
            x, y = map(find, xy)
            if x == y:
                return 0
            parent[y] = x
            return 1
            
        edges.sort(reverse=True)
        remove = res = 0
        for t, u, v in edges:
            remove += union((u, v))
        if any(find(u) != find(v) for u, v in ((1, i) for i in range(1, n+1))):
            return -1
        res = len(edges) - remove
        return res
```
This code first initializes the parent array to track the union-find sets. Then it defines two helper functions: find() to find the root of a node and union() to merge two nodes into one set.

Next, it sorts the edges in descending order based on their type (since we prefer deleting higher-value edges first). For each edge, it tries to merge its two endpoints. If they are already in the same set, it means this edge will create a cycle, so we skip it; otherwise, we add the weight of the edge to the result.

Finally, after all edges have been processed, if there are still unconnected nodes, it means we cannot connect all nodes together, so we return -1; otherwise, we subtract the total number of removed edges from the total number of edges to get the maximum number of edges we can remove.

Time complexity: O(MlogM + N), where M is the number of edges and N is the number of vertices.
Space complexity: O(N), for the parent array.

Note: This solution assumes that the graph is a tree
ref:
from collections import defaultdict

def dfs(node, parent, nums, graph, total, result):
    total_sum = nums[node]
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            total_sum += dfs(neighbor, node, nums, graph, total, result)
    if total_sum == total // 2:
        result.append(1)
        return 0
    return total_sum

def delete_edges_to_balance_tree(nums, edges):
    n = len(nums)
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for e in edges:
        graph[e[0]].append(e[1])
        graph[e[1]].append(e[0])

    total = sum(nums)
    if total % 2 != 0:
        return 0  # It is impossible to split the tree fairly.

    result = []
    dfs(0, -1, nums, graph, total, result)
    return len(result) - 1

**Solution:**

This problem can be solved by using Binary Search and DFS/BFS to find the boundaries of the smallest rectangle. 

Here is the Python solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def minArea(self, image: List[List[str]], x: int, y: int) -> int:
        if not image:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(image), len(image[0])
        directions = [(0,1),(0,-1),(-1,0),(1,0)]
        min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col = x, x, y, y
        
        # Perform DFS to find the boundaries of the rectangle
        stack = [(x, y)]
        while stack:
            row, col = stack.pop()
            for dx, dy in directions:
                new_row, new_col = row + dx, col + dy
                if 0 <= new_row < m and 0 <= new_col < n and image[new_row][new_col] == '1':
                    stack.append((new_row, new_col))
                    image[new_row][new_col] = '0'
                    min_row, max_row = min(min_row, new_row), max(max_row, new_row)
                    min_col, max_col = min(min_col, new_col), max(max_col, new_col)
        
        return (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)
```

In this solution, we first perform a depth-first search starting from the initial point (x, y) to find all the black pixels in the image. We keep track of the minimum and maximum rows and columns. 

Finally, we calculate the area of the smallest rectangle by multiplying the difference between the maximum and minimum rows plus 1 by the difference between the maximum and minimum columns plus 1.

This solution has time complexity O(m*n) as it visits each cell once during the depth-first search. The space complexity is also O(m*n) due to the recursion stack in the
ref:
def minArea(image, x, y):
    top, bottom, left, right = x, x, y, y
    for i, row in enumerate(image):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == '1':
                top, bottom = min(top, i), max(bottom, i)
                left, right = min(left, j), max(right, j)
    return (bottom - top + 1) * (right - left + 1)

            if len(digits) == 10: return local
            return "+{}-{}".format("*" * (len(digits) - 10), local)
```
This solution uses Python's built-in string methods and list comprehension. It splits the input string into name and domain for emails, or digits for phone numbers. Then it applies the corresponding masks to them. For the email case, it replaces the middle part of the name with five asterisks and converts the whole thing to lowercase. For the phone case, it generates a masked local part of the number and then appends it to the appropriate number of asterisks for the country code.

Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we process each character once. Space complexity is also O(n) because we store the input string and the result.

It can be further optimized by avoiding extra space usage.

```python
class Solution:
    def maskPII(self, S: str) -> str:
        if "@" in S: # email

            digits = re.sub(r'\D', '', S)

Solution:
This problem can be solved using HashMap and Doubly LinkedList. We use a hashmap to record the count of each string, and use a doubly linkedlist to record the order of the string by its count. In the node of the doubly linkedlist, we also use another hashmap to record the strings that have the same count.

In `inc` function, if the string exists, we just increment its count in the hashmap and adjust its position in the doubly linkedlist. If the string doesn't exist, we add it to the doubly linkedlist head (since the count is 1 now), and add it to the hashmap.

In `dec` function, we first decrement the count in the hashmap. If the count becomes 0, we remove it from the doubly linkedlist and hashmap. Otherwise, we adjust its position in the doubly linkedlist.

In `getMaxKey` and `getMinKey` function, we return the first and last node's first string in the doubly linkedlist, since they have the max and min counts respectively.

Solution:
This problem can be solved by using the concept of sliding window and prefix sum.

First, we need to find the longest length of consecutive strictly increasing numbers in the array. This can be done by iterating through the array and keep track of the current length of consecutive strictly increasing numbers. When the current number is not greater than the previous one, we reset the current length. Then, we can use this information to calculate the number of subarrays.

For each element, there are `i` elements before it that are smaller (because these elements are on the left side of the current element). And there are `n - i - 1` elements after it that are larger (because these elements are on the right side of the current element). So, for each element, there are `(i+1) * (n - i - 1)` subarrays that include this element. The total number of subarrays is the sum of all these numbers.

Here is the Python code for this solution:

```python
def countSubarrays(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    inc_len = 1
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
            inc_len += 1
        else:
            total += ((inc_len+1) * inc_len // 2)
            inc_len = 1
    total += ((inc_len+1) * inc_len // 2)
    return total
```

In this code, `inc_len` is the length of the current subarray that is strictly increasing. `total` is the total number of subarrays. For each element, we add `((inc_len+1) * inc_len // 2)` to `total` because there are `(inc_len+1) * inc_len // 2` subarrays that include this element. We then reset `inc_len` to 1. After the loop, we add the last `inc_len` to `total` and return `total` as the result.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space

def num_strictly_increasing_subarrays(nums):
    n = len(nums)

            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        sum += count
    return sum + n

Solution:
The problem can be solved by using stack data structure. We will iterate through the array from left to right once and keep track of the indices of the elements in a decreasing order. Then we will iterate through the array from right to left and for each element, we will try to find a suitable index from the stack that makes the width of the ramp maximum.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
def maxWidthRamp(nums):
    stack = []
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if not stack or num < nums[stack[-1]]:
            stack.append(i)
    
    max_width = 0
    for j in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] <= nums[j]:
            max_width = max(max_width, j - stack.pop())
            
    return max_width
```

This solution has time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n). It first finds the increasing sequence of numbers and then finds the maximum width of the ramp from right to left.

This solution is based on the idea that a ramp's width should be as large as possible, so we need to find the smallest number after a larger number. And this idea can be implemented by using a stack to store the indices of the numbers that are still larger than those before them.

For example, given the input \[9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1\], the stack will initially contain \[0\]. After the next iteration, it will contain \[0, 3\]. After the next iteration, it will contain \[0, 3, 5\]. So on and so forth until we reach the end of the array. When we start iterating from the end to the beginning, for each number, we pop out the indices from the stack that are larger than the current number, and calculate the width of the ramp between these indices and the current index. We keep track of the maximum width of all these ramp widths.

Finally, we return the maximum width as the result.

Solution:
This problem can be solved by dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D dp table where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reach the position j with i steps remaining. For each step, we have three options: moving left, moving right, or staying in the same position. We update the dp table accordingly.

Python Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, steps: int, arrLen: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        dp = [[0] * min(arrLen, steps+1) for _ in range(steps+1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for i in range(1, steps+1):
            for j in range(min(i+1, arrLen)):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]
                if j < i and j < arrLen - 1:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j+1]
                dp[i][j] %= MOD
        return dp[steps][0]
```
In this code, we initialize a 2D dp table with all elements as 0. Then we fill up the dp table according to the rules of the problem. For each step, we calculate the number of ways to reach each possible position. Finally, we return the number of ways to reach the position 0 with the given number of steps. We take modulo 1e9+7 to prevent overflow.

The time complexity of this code is O(steps * min(arrLen, steps+1)), which is feasible given the constraints of the problem. The space complexity is also O(steps * min(arrLen, steps+1)), due to the dp table.

This approach ensures that we cover all possible states and transitions, thus giving us the correct solution to the problem.

Note: This solution assumes that arrLen >= steps. If arrLen < steps, then there will be no way to stay at index 0 after exactly 'steps' steps, so the function
ref:
from functools import lru_cache

mod = 10**9 + 7

def numOfWays(steps: int, arrLen: int) -> int:
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dp(s, p):
        if p < 0 or p >= arrLen or p > steps - p:
            return 0
        if s == 0:
            return p == 0
        return (dp(s - 1, p - 1) + dp(s - 1, p) + dp(s - 1, p + 1)) % mod

    return dp(steps, 0)

Solution:
This problem can be solved by using the concept of prefix sum and difference between two consecutive elements in the array.

In Python, we first calculate the total number of zeros and ones in the string. Then we count the number of zeros and ones that should be at even index and at odd index respectively. The minimum number of changes required to make the string alternating is the minimum of the differences between the actual counts and the expected counts.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minOperations(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        # Calculate the total number of zeros and ones
        total_0 = s.count('0')
        total_1 = n - total_0
        # Calculate the number of zeros and ones at even index and at odd index
        even_0 = sum(s[i] == '0' for i in range(0, n, 2))
        even_1 = total_0 - even_0
        odd_0 = total_1 - (sum(s[i] == '0' for i in range(1, n, 2)))
        odd_1 = sum(s[i] == '1' for i in range(1, n, 2))
        # Return the minimum number of changes
        return min(even_0 + odd_1, even_1 + odd_0)
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it scans through the string once, and a space complexity of O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space.

Please note that this solution assumes that the string starts with '0'. If the string starts with '1', we would need to adjust the counting of zeros and ones at even and odd indices accordingly.

Also note that this solution does not handle the case where the input string is empty or contains characters other than '0' and '1'. You may want to add error checking code to handle these edge cases.
