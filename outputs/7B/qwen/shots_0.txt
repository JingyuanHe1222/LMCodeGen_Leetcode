['<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, You are a helpful assistant for code generation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow it\'s your turn\ngenerate python code for the following leetcode question: A polynomial linked list is a special type of linked list where every node represents a term in a polynomial expression.\n\nEach node has three attributes:\n\n*   `coefficient`: an integer representing the number multiplier of the term. The coefficient of the term `**9**x4` is `9`.\n*   `power`: an integer representing the exponent. The power of the term `9x**4**` is `4`.\n*   `next`: a pointer to the next node in the list, or `null` if it is the last node of the list.\n\nFor example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` is represented by the polynomial linked list illustrated below:\n\nThe polynomial linked list must be in its standard form: the polynomial must be in **strictly** descending order by its `power` value. Also, terms with a `coefficient` of `0` are omitted.\n\nGiven two polynomial linked list heads, `poly1` and `poly2`, add the polynomials together and return _the head of the sum of the polynomials_.\n\n**`PolyNode` format:**\n\nThe input/output format is as a list of `n` nodes, where each node is represented as its `[coefficient, power]`. For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` would be represented as: `[[5,3],[4,1],[-7,0]]`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** poly1 = \\[\\[1,1\\]\\], poly2 = \\[\\[1,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[1,0\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** poly1 = x. poly2 = 1. The sum is x + 1.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** poly1 = \\[\\[2,2\\],\\[4,1\\],\\[3,0\\]\\], poly2 = \\[\\[3,2\\],\\[-4,1\\],\\[-1,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[5,2\\],\\[2,0\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** poly1 = 2x2 + 4x + 3. poly2 = 3x2 - 4x - 1. The sum is 5x2 + 2. Notice that we omit the  "0x " term.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** poly1 = \\[\\[1,2\\]\\], poly2 = \\[\\[-1,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\]\n**Explanation:** The sum is 0. We return an empty list.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `0 <= n <= 104`\n*   `-109 <= PolyNode.coefficient <= 109`\n*   `PolyNode.coefficient != 0`\n*   `0 <= PolyNode.power <= 109`\n*   `PolyNode.power > PolyNode.next.power`\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n']

This Python code defines a `PolyNode` class to represent each term in the polynomial linked list and a function `addPoly` to add two polynomial linked lists together. The function iterates through both lists, compares the powers of the terms, and sums the coefficients of terms with the same power. If the sum of coefficients is not zero, it creates a new node with the sum and appends it to the result list. The function handles cases where one list is longer than the other by appending the remaining nodes directly to the result list.

This solution uses a max heap to always place the most frequent barcode that is not the same as the previous one. The heap ensures that we always have access to the barcode with the highest remaining frequency, allowing us to avoid placing two adjacent barcodes that are the same.

This Python code defines a method `isAdditiveNumber` that takes a string `num` as input and returns `True` if the string is an additive number, otherwise it returns `False`. The method uses a helper function `backtrack` to recursively check all possible combinations of numbers in the string to see if they form an additive sequence. The constraints are handled by checking for leading zeros and ensuring that the sum of the last two numbers equals the next number in the sequence.

This solution works by generating all powers of 2 up to \(2^{30}\) (since \(2^{30}\) is the largest power of 2 within the given constraints) and storing their digit strings in a set after sorting the digits.

This solution uses the sliding window technique to find the minimum window substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t`. It maintains a dictionary `dict_t` to count the frequency of each character in `t`, and another dictionary `window_counts` to count the frequency of characters in the current window. The variable `formed` keeps track of how many unique characters have been formed in the current window that match the characters in `t`. The variables `l` and `r` represent the left and right boundaries of the sliding window, respectively. The variable `ans` stores the length of the minimum window and its start and end indices.

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum length of the substring that needs to be replaced to make the string balanced. The `count` dictionary keeps track of the excess of each character, and the `current_count` dictionary keeps track of the counts within the current window. The window is expanded by moving the `right` pointer and contracted by moving the `left` pointer when the window is balanced.

This solution uses a dictionary to keep track of the flipped cells and ensures that each cell is equally likely to be chosen. The `flip` method selects a random index, adjusts for already flipped cells, and returns the corresponding row and column indices. The `reset` method clears the flipped cells and resets the total number of cells.

The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number `0`, then the student number `1`, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number `n - 1`. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number `0` again.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `chalk` and an integer `k`. There are initially `k` pieces of chalk. When the student number `i` is given a problem to solve, they will use `chalk[i]` pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is **strictly less** than `chalk[i]`, then the student number `i` will be asked to **replace** the chalk.\n\nReturn _the **index** of the student that will **replace** the chalk pieces_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** chalk = \\[5,1,5\\], k = 22\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The students go in turns as follows:\n- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.\n- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.\n- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.\n- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.\n- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.\n- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.\nStudent number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** chalk = \\[3,4,1,2\\], k = 25\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The students go in turns as follows:\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 22.\n- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 18.\n- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 17.\n- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 15.\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 12.\n- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 8.\n- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 7.\n- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 5.\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 2.\nStudent number 1 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `chalk.length == n`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= chalk[i] <= 105`\n*   `1 <= k <= 109`\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"]

This solution first calculates the total amount of chalk used in one full cycle and reduces `k` modulo this total to account for multiple complete cycles. Then, it iterates through the list of chalk usages, subtracting each usage from `k` until `k` is less than the current student's usage, indicating that the current student needs to replace the chalk.

["<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, You are a helpful assistant for code generation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow it's your turn\ngenerate python code for the following leetcode question: You are given all the nodes of an **[N-ary tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/n-ary-tree/)** as an array of `Node` objects, where each node has a **unique value**.\n\nReturn _the **root** of the N-ary tree_.\n\n**Custom testing:**\n\nAn N-ary tree can be serialized as represented in its level order traversal where each group of children is separated by the `null` value (see examples).\n\nFor example, the above tree is serialized as `[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`.\n\nThe testing will be done in the following way:\n\n1.  The **input data** should be provided as a serialization of the tree.\n2.  The driver code will construct the tree from the serialized input data and put each `Node` object into an array **in an arbitrary order**.\n3.  The driver code will pass the array to `findRoot`, and your function should find and return the root `Node` object in the array.\n4.  The driver code will take the returned `Node` object and serialize it. If the serialized value and the input data are the **same**, the test **passes**.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tree = \\[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6\\]\n**Explanation:** The tree from the input data is shown above.\nThe driver code creates the tree and gives findRoot the Node objects in an arbitrary order.\nFor example, the passed array could be \\[Node(5),Node(4),Node(3),Node(6),Node(2),Node(1)\\] or \\[Node(2),Node(6),Node(1),Node(3),Node(5),Node(4)\\].\nThe findRoot function should return the root Node(1), and the driver code will serialize it and compare with the input data.\nThe input data and serialized Node(1) are the same, so the test passes.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tree = \\[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The total number of nodes is between `[1, 5 * 104]`.\n*   Each node has a **unique** value.\n\n**Follow up:**\n\n*   Could you solve this problem in constant space complexity with a linear time algorithm?\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"]

This solution works as follows:

1. We create a dictionary `feature_popularity` to store the popularity of each feature, initialized to 0.

2. We create a set `unique_words` to store unique words from the responses to avoid counting the same word multiple times in a response.

3. We iterate over each response and split it into words, adding each unique word to the `unique_words` set.

4. We iterate over each unique word and check if it is a feature. If it is, we increment its popularity count in the `feature_popularity` dictionary.

5. We sort the features based on their popularity in descending order. If two features have the same popularity, they are ordered by their original index in the `features` list.

6. Finally, we return the sorted list of features.

Two different cities with labels `x` and `y` are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if `x` and `y` share a common divisor **strictly greater** than some `threshold`. More formally, cities with labels `x` and `y` have a road between them if there exists an integer `z` such that all of the following are true:\n\n*   `x % z == 0`,\n*   `y % z == 0`, and\n*   `z > threshold`.\n\nGiven the two integers, `n` and `threshold`, and an array of `queries`, you must determine for each `queries[i] = [ai, bi]` if cities `ai` and `bi` are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).\n\nReturn _an array_ `answer`_, where_ `answer.length == queries.length` _and_ `answer[i]` _is_ `true` _if for the_ `ith` _query, there is a path between_ `ai` _and_ `bi`_, or_ `answer[i]` _is_ `false` _if there is no path._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = \\[\\[1,4\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[3,6\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[false,false,true\\]\n**Explanation:** The divisors for each number:\n1:   1\n2:   1, 2\n3:   1, 3\n4:   1, 2, 4\n5:   1, 5\n6:   1, 2, 3, 6\nUsing the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the\nonly ones directly connected.

Shifting a character by `i` means applying the shift operations `i` times.\n\nRemember that any index `j` can be picked at most once.\n\nReturn `true` if it\'s possible to convert `s` into `t` in no more than `k` moves, otherwise return `false`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  "input ", t =  "ouput ", k = 9\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** In the 6th move, we shift \'i\' 6 times to get \'o\'. And in the 7th move we shift \'n\' to get \'u\'.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  "abc ", t =  "bcd ", k = 10\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** We need to shift each character in s one time to convert it into t. We can shift \'a\' to \'b\' during the 1st move. However, there is no way to shift the other characters in the remaining moves to obtain t from s.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  "aab ", t =  "bbb ", k = 27\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** In the 1st move, we shift the first \'a\' 1 time to get \'b\'.

This solution works as follows:

1. Initialize the number of operations to 0.
2. Traverse the array from the second last element to the first element.
3. For each element, if it is greater than the next element, calculate the number of parts it needs to be split into so that all parts are less than or equal to the next element.
4. Add the number of operations needed to split the current element to the total operations count.
5. Update the current element to be the largest possible value in the first part after splitting.
6. Return the total number of operations required to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

This solution uses a sliding window approach with a dictionary to keep track of the count of characters within the current window. The window is expanded by moving the `right` pointer and contracted by moving the `left` pointer when more than two distinct characters are found. The maximum length of the valid window is tracked and returned as the result.

This solution iterates through all possible binary strings of length `n` using a loop that runs from `0` to `2^n - 1`. For each iteration, it converts the integer to a binary string, pads it with leading zeros to ensure it has length `n`, and checks if it is not in the given list `nums`. If it finds such a string, it returns it immediately. This approach ensures that the returned string is unique and not present in the input list.

        # Convert piles into a max heap by negating the values

```

This solution uses a max heap to efficiently perform the operations. By negating the values, we can use Python's `heapq` module, which implements a min heap by default. After each operation, we push the updated pile back into the heap. Finally, we sum up the piles after all operations are completed.

This implementation uses two stacks: `stack` for storing all elements and `max_stack` for keeping track of the maximum elements. The `push` operation adds an element to both stacks if it is greater than or equal to the current maximum. The `pop` operation removes the top element from both stacks if it is the current maximum. The `top` operation simply returns the top element of the `stack`. The `peekMax` operation returns the top element of the `max_stack`. The `popMax` operation finds the maximum value, pops all elements until it reaches the maximum, removes the maximum, and then pushes back all the popped elements. This ensures that the `max_stack` remains valid after the operation.

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.\n2.  At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.\n3.  It repeats until no input elements remain.\n\nThe following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[4,2,1,3\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,2,3,4\\]\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[-1,5,3,4,0\\]\n**Output:** \\[-1,0,3,4,5\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5000]`.\n*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"]

        return result
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: We first convert all the numbers in the list to strings because we need to compare them as strings to determine their order in the final result.

2. **Custom Comparator**: We define a custom comparator function that compares two strings `x` and `y` by comparing the concatenated results of `y + x` and `x + y`. This ensures that the order of the strings will form the largest possible number when concatenated.

3. **Sort the Numbers**: We sort the list of strings using the custom comparator. The `cmp_to_key` function from the `functools` module is used to convert the comparator function into a key function that can be used with the `sort` method.

4. **Join the Sorted Numbers**: After sorting, we join the list of strings into a single string.

5. **Handle Leading Zeros**: If the resulting string starts with '0', it means all numbers were zeros, so we return '0'.

This approach ensures that the numbers are arranged to form the largest possible number, and it handles the constraints efficiently.

["<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, You are a helpful assistant for code generation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow it's your turn\ngenerate python code for the following leetcode question: You are given an integer `hoursBefore`, the number of hours you have to travel to your meeting. To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through `n` roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array `dist` of length `n`, where `dist[i]` describes the length of the `ith` road in **kilometers**. In addition, you are given an integer `speed`, which is the speed (in **km/h**) you will travel at.\n\nAfter you travel road `i`, you must rest and wait for the **next integer hour** before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.\n\n*   For example, if traveling a road takes `1.4` hours, you must wait until the `2` hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly `2` hours, you do not need to wait.\n\nHowever, you are allowed to **skip** some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.\n\n*   For example, suppose traveling the first road takes `1.4` hours and traveling the second road takes `0.6` hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the `2` hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.\n\nReturn _the **minimum number of skips required** to arrive at the meeting on time, or_ `-1` _if it is **impossible**_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** dist = \\[1,3,2\\], speed = 4, hoursBefore = 2\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nWithout skipping any rests, you will arrive in (1/4 + 3/4) + (3/4 + 1/4) + (2/4) = 2.5 hours.\nYou can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) = 1.5 hours.\nNote that the second rest is shortened because you finish traveling the second road at an integer hour due to skipping the first rest.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** dist = \\[7,3,5,5\\], speed = 2, hoursBefore = 10\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nWithout skipping any rests, you will arrive in (7/2 + 1/2) + (3/2 + 1/2) + (5/2 + 1/2) + (5/2) = 11.5 hours.\nYou can skip the first and third rest to arrive in ((7/2 + 0) + (3/2 + 0)) + ((5/2 + 0) + (5/2)) = 10 hours.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** dist = \\[7,3,5,5\\], speed = 1, hoursBefore = 10\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** It is impossible to arrive at the meeting on time even if you skip all the rests.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == dist.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= dist[i] <= 105`\n*   `1 <= speed <= 106`\n*   `1 <= hoursBefore <= 107`\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"]

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time. The `dp` table is used to store the minimum time required to reach each road with a certain number of skips. The final answer is the smallest number of skips such that the total time is less than or equal to `hoursBefore * speed`.

There is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.\n\nReturn _the median array for each window in the original array_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual value will be accepted.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7\\], k = 3\n**Output:** \\[1.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,5.00000,6.00000\\]\n**Explanation:** \nWindow position                Median\n---------------                -----\n\\[**1  3  -1**\\] -3  5  3  6  7        1\n 1 \\[**3  -1  -3**\\] 5  3  6  7       -1\n 1  3 \\[**\\-1  -3  5**\\] 3  6  7       -1\n 1  3  -1 \\[**\\-3  5  3**\\] 6  7        3\n 1  3  -1  -3 \\[**5  3  6**\\] 7        5\n 1  3  -1  -3  5 \\[**3  6  7**\\]       6\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,2,3,4,2,3,1,4,2\\], k = 3\n**Output:** \\[2.00000,3.00000,3.00000,3.00000,2.00000,3.00000,2.00000\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"]

This solution uses a sorted list to maintain the current window of elements and the `bisect` module to efficiently insert and remove elements while keeping the list sorted. The median is calculated based on whether the window size is odd or even.

        # Sort the costs array in ascending order
        costs.sort()

        # Return the maximum number of ice cream bars bought
        return count
```

This solution uses a counting sort approach to first sort the array of ice cream bar costs in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted array, buying as many ice cream bars as possible until the boy runs out of coins. The function returns the maximum number of ice cream bars that can be bought.

Please be careful during the calculations.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** word =  "aba "\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** \nAll possible substrings are:  "a ",  "ab ",  "aba ",  "b ",  "ba ", and  "a ".\n-  "b " has 0 vowels in it\n-  "a ",  "ab ",  "ba ", and  "a " have 1 vowel each\n-  "aba " has 2 vowels in it\nHence, the total sum of vowels = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** word =  "abc "\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** \nAll possible substrings are:  "a ",  "ab ",  "abc ",  "b ",  "bc ", and  "c ".\n-  "a ",  "ab ", and  "abc " have 1 vowel each\n-  "b ",  "bc ", and  "c " have 0 vowels each\nHence, the total sum of vowels = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** word =  "ltcd "\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are no vowels in any substring of  "ltcd ".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= word.length <= 105`\n*   `word` consists of lowercase English letters.\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n']

                result += (i + 1) * (n - i)
        
        return result
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We define a set of vowels for quick lookup.
2. We initialize the result to 0.
3. We iterate through each character in the word.
4. If the character is a vowel, we calculate its contribution to the total sum of vowels in all substrings that include this character. The contribution is `(i + 1) * (n - i)`, where `i` is the current index and `n` is the length of the word. This formula comes from the fact that a vowel at position `i` can form substrings with any starting position from `0` to `i` and any ending position from `i` to `n-1`.
5. Finally, we return the result.

You have the ability to rotate the gondolas **counterclockwise**, which costs you `runningCost` dollars.\n\nYou are given an array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of new customers arriving just before the `ith` rotation (0-indexed). This means you **must rotate the wheel** `i` **times before the** `customers[i]` **customers arrive**. **You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola**. Each customer pays `boardingCost` dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.\n\nYou can stop the wheel at any time, including **before** **serving** **all** **customers**. If you decide to stop serving customers, **all subsequent rotations are free** in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait **for the next rotation**.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit._ If there is **no scenario** where the profit is positive, return `-1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** customers = \\[8,3\\], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.\n1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates.

['<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, You are a helpful assistant for code generation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow it\'s your turn\ngenerate python code for the following leetcode question: Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array `paths`, where `paths[i]` is an array representing an absolute path to the `ith` folder in the file system.\n\n*   For example, `[ "one ", "two ", "three "]` represents the path `"/one/two/three "`.\n\nTwo folders (not necessarily on the same level) are **identical** if they contain the **same non-empty** set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders **do not** need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are **identical**, then **mark** the folders as well as all their subfolders.\n\n*   For example, folders `"/a "` and `"/b "` in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should **all** be marked:\n    *   `/a`\n    *   `/a/x`\n    *   `/a/x/y`\n    *   `/a/z`\n    *   `/b`\n    *   `/b/x`\n    *   `/b/x/y`\n    *   `/b/z`\n*   However, if the file structure also included the path `"/b/w "`, then the folders `"/a "` and `"/b "` would not be identical. Note that `"/a/x "` and `"/b/x "` would still be considered identical even with the added folder.\n\nOnce all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will **delete** all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.\n\nReturn _the 2D array_ `ans` _containing the paths of the **remaining** folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in **any** order_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** paths = \\[\\[ "a "\\],\\[ "c "\\],\\[ "d "\\],\\[ "a ", "b "\\],\\[ "c ", "b "\\],\\[ "d ", "a "\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[ "d "\\],\\[ "d ", "a "\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** The file structure is as shown.\nFolders  "/a " and  "/c " (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty\nfolder named  "b ".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** paths = \\[\\[ "a "\\],\\[ "c "\\],\\[ "a ", "b "\\],\\[ "c ", "b "\\],\\[ "a ", "b ", "x "\\],\\[ "a ", "b ", "x ", "y "\\],\\[ "w "\\],\\[ "w ", "y "\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[ "c "\\],\\[ "c ", "b "\\],\\[ "a "\\],\\[ "a ", "b "\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** The file structure is as shown. \nFolders  "/a/b/x " and  "/w " (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named  "y ".\nNote that folders  "/a " and  "/c " are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** paths = \\[\\[ "a ", "b "\\],\\[ "c ", "d "\\],\\[ "c "\\],\\[ "a "\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[ "c "\\],\\[ "c ", "d "\\],\\[ "a "\\],\\[ "a ", "b "\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** All folders are unique in the file system.\nNote that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104`\n*   `1 <= paths[i].length <= 500`\n*   `1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10`\n*   `1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 105`\n*   `path[i][j]` consists of lowercase English letters.\n*   No two paths lead to the same folder.\n*   For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n']

['<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, You are a helpful assistant for code generation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow it\'s your turn\ngenerate python code for the following leetcode question: Design a **Skiplist** without using any built-in libraries.\n\nA **skiplist** is a data structure that takes `O(log(n))` time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\n\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\n  \nArtyom Kalinin \\[CC BY-SA 3.0\\], via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skip_list_add_element-en.gif "Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons")\n\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than `O(n)`. It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is `O(log(n))` and space complexity is `O(n)`.\n\nSee more about Skiplist: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip\\_list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list)\n\nImplement the `Skiplist` class:\n\n*   `Skiplist()` Initializes the object of the skiplist.\n*   `bool search(int target)` Returns `true` if the integer `target` exists in the Skiplist or `false` otherwise.\n*   `void add(int num)` Inserts the value `num` into the SkipList.\n*   `bool erase(int num)` Removes the value `num` from the Skiplist and returns `true`. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return `false`. If there exist multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ "Skiplist ",  "add ",  "add ",  "add ",  "search ",  "add ",  "search ",  "erase ",  "erase ",  "search "\\]\n\\[\\[\\], \\[1\\], \\[2\\], \\[3\\], \\[0\\], \\[4\\], \\[1\\], \\[0\\], \\[1\\], \\[1\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0); // return False\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1); // return True\nskiplist.erase(0);  // return False, 0 is not in skiplist.\nskiplist.erase(1);  // return True\nskiplist.search(1); // return False, 1 has already been erased.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `0 <= num, target <= 2 * 104`\n*   At most `5 * 104` calls will be made to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n']

This solution works as follows:

1. **Counting Request Frequencies**: We use a prefix sum array to count how many times each index in `nums` is requested. For each request `[start, end]`, we increment `prefix_sum[start]` and decrement `prefix_sum[end + 1]`.

2. **Calculating Actual Frequencies**: We convert the prefix sum array into the actual frequency of each index being requested by iterating through the array and adding the previous value to the current value.

3. **Sorting**: We sort both the frequency array and the `nums` array. Sorting helps in maximizing the sum by pairing the highest frequency with the highest value.

4. **Calculating Maximum Sum**: We calculate the maximum sum by multiplying the frequency of each index with the corresponding value from the sorted `nums` array and taking the modulo `10^9 + 7`.

This approach ensures that we get the maximum possible sum of all requests among all permutations of `nums`. 63%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž   | 19/30 [04:21<02:30, 13.69s/it]

This solution works as follows:

1. **Count the Frequency**: We use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Track Unique Frequencies**: We maintain a set `unique_freq` to keep track of frequencies that have already been used.

3. **Adjust Frequencies**: For each frequency in the character counts:
   - If the frequency is already in the `unique_freq` set, we decrement it until it becomes unique or zero.
   - Each decrement increases the deletion count by one.

4. **Return Deletions**: Finally, we return the total number of deletions required to make the string "good".

This approach ensures that we minimize the number of deletions by only reducing frequencies when necessary and keeping track of which frequencies have already been used.

This solution uses a greedy approach combined with a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the courses taken. The courses are sorted by their `lastDayi` to ensure that we only consider courses that can be completed within the given time frame. For each course, we add its duration to the total time and push the negative duration onto the max-heap. If the total time exceeds the `lastDayi`, we remove the course with the longest duration from the heap to make room for the current course. Finally, the length of the max-heap represents the maximum number of courses that can be taken.

['<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, You are a helpful assistant for code generation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow it\'s your turn\ngenerate python code for the following leetcode question: You are given two **0-indexed** arrays of strings `startWords` and `targetWords`. Each string consists of **lowercase English letters** only.\n\nFor each string in `targetWords`, check if it is possible to choose a string from `startWords` and perform a **conversion operation** on it to be equal to that from `targetWords`.\n\nThe **conversion operation** is described in the following two steps:\n\n1.  **Append** any lowercase letter that is **not present** in the string to its end.\n    *   For example, if the string is `"abc "`, the letters `\'d\'`, `\'e\'`, or `\'y\'` can be added to it, but not `\'a\'`. If `\'d\'` is added, the resulting string will be `"abcd "`.\n2.  **Rearrange** the letters of the new string in **any** arbitrary order.\n    *   For example, `"abcd "` can be rearranged to `"acbd "`, `"bacd "`, `"cbda "`, and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to `"abcd "` itself.\n\nReturn _the **number of strings** in_ `targetWords` _that can be obtained by performing the operations on **any** string of_ `startWords`.\n\n**Note** that you will only be verifying if the string in `targetWords` can be obtained from a string in `startWords` by performing the operations. The strings in `startWords` **do not** actually change during this process.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** startWords = \\[ "ant ", "act ", "tack "\\], targetWords = \\[ "tack ", "act ", "acti "\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\n- In order to form targetWords\\[0\\] =  "tack ", we use startWords\\[1\\] =  "act ", append \'k\' to it, and rearrange  "actk " to  "tack ".\n- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords\\[1\\] =  "act ".\n  Note that  "act " does exist in startWords, but we **must** append one letter to the string before rearranging it.\n- In order to form targetWords\\[2\\] =  "acti ", we use startWords\\[1\\] =  "act ", append \'i\' to it, and rearrange  "acti " to  "acti " itself.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** startWords = \\[ "ab ", "a "\\], targetWords = \\[ "abc ", "abcd "\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\n- In order to form targetWords\\[0\\] =  "abc ", we use startWords\\[0\\] =  "ab ", add \'c\' to it, and rearrange it to  "abc ".\n- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords\\[1\\] =  "abcd ".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= startWords.length, targetWords.length <= 5 * 104`\n*   `1 <= startWords[i].length, targetWords[j].length <= 26`\n*   Each string of `startWords` and `targetWords` consists of lowercase English letters only.\n*   No letter occurs more than once in any string of `startWords` or `targetWords`.\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n']

This solution class defines a method `basicCalculatorIV` that takes an expression and evaluation maps as input and returns a list of tokens representing the simplified expression. The method uses a dictionary to store the evaluation map, replaces variables in the expression with their evaluated values, and defines a helper function `parse` to parse the expression and evaluate it according to the given rules.

```

This solution iterates through all possible combinations of three points and calculates the area of the triangle formed by them using the Shoelace formula (or Gauss's area formula for polygons). It keeps track of the maximum area found and returns it.

["<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, You are a helpful assistant for code generation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow it's your turn\ngenerate python code for the following leetcode question: You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei]` denotes that `amounti` orders have been placed of type `orderTypei` at the price `pricei`. The `orderTypei` is:\n\n*   `0` if it is a batch of `buy` orders, or\n*   `1` if it is a batch of `sell` orders.\n\nNote that `orders[i]` represents a batch of `amounti` independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by `orders[i]` will be placed before all orders represented by `orders[i+1]` for all valid `i`.\n\nThere is a **backlog** that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:\n\n*   If the order is a `buy` order, you look at the `sell` order with the **smallest** price in the backlog. If that `sell` order's price is **smaller than or equal to** the current `buy` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `sell` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `buy` order is added to the backlog.\n*   Vice versa, if the order is a `sell` order, you look at the `buy` order with the **largest** price in the backlog. If that `buy` order's price is **larger than or equal to** the current `sell` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `buy` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `sell` order is added to the backlog.\n\nReturn _the total **amount** of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input_. Since this number can be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** orders = \\[\\[10,5,0\\],\\[15,2,1\\],\\[25,1,1\\],\\[30,4,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** Here is what happens with the orders:\n- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.\n- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.\nFinally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** orders = \\[\\[7,1000000000,1\\],\\[15,3,0\\],\\[5,999999995,0\\],\\[5,1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 999999984\n**Explanation:** Here is what happens with the orders:\n- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.\n- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.\nFinally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= orders.length <= 105`\n*   `orders[i].length == 3`\n*   `1 <= pricei, amounti <= 109`\n*   `orderTypei` is either `0` or `1`.\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"]

```

This solution works as follows:

1. We create a dummy node to help with the sorting process. This dummy node acts as the new head of the sorted list.

2. We traverse the original linked list using a pointer `head`.

3. For each node, we check if its value is negative:
   - If it is negative, we remove it from its current position and insert it at the front of the new sorted list.
   - If it is not negative, we simply move to the next node.

4. After traversing all nodes, we set the end of the sorted list to `None` to properly terminate the list.

5. Finally, we return the next node of the dummy node, which is the new head of the sorted list.

This approach ensures that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the actual values of its nodes, and it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Graph Construction**: We build an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given edges. Each entry in the adjacency list contains tuples of the form `(score, neighbor)`.

2. **Top 3 Neighbors**: For each node, we keep only the top 3 highest scoring neighbors. This helps in reducing the number of combinations we need to check later.

3. **Sequence Validation**: We iterate over all edges and for each edge `(u, v)`, we consider all possible sequences of length 4 by combining the top 3 neighbors of `u` and `v` (ensuring no node is repeated). We calculate the score of each valid sequence and keep track of the maximum score found.

4. **Result**: Finally, we return the maximum score of any valid sequence of length 4. If no such sequence exists, the function returns `-1`.

This solution iterates through each number in the range `[low, high]` and counts the occurrences of the digit `d` in each number. The helper function `count_d_in_range` checks how many times the digit `d` appears in a given number. The main function sums up these counts for all numbers in the specified range and returns the total count.

This implementation uses a dictionary to store the last printed timestamp for each message. When `shouldPrintMessage` is called, it checks if the message has been printed before and if the time elapsed since the last print is less than 10 seconds. If so, it returns `False` to prevent printing the message again. Otherwise, it updates the timestamp for the message and returns `True` to allow printing the message.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - We calculate the size of the valid range as `n - len(blacklist)`.
   - We create a dictionary `mapping` to store mappings from blacklisted numbers within the valid range to valid numbers.
   - We use a variable `last` to keep track of the last valid number.
   - For each blacklisted number `b` that is within the valid range, we find the last valid number that is not blacklisted and map `b` to it.
   - We decrement `last` to ensure we don't reuse any valid numbers.

2. **Picking a Random Number (`pick` method)**:
   - We generate a random number `r` in the range `[0, self.size - 1]`.
   - If `r` is in the `mapping`, we return the mapped value; otherwise, we return `r` itself.

This approach ensures that all valid numbers have an equal probability of being picked, and it minimizes the number of calls to the built-in

If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  "abcd ", t =  "bcdf ", maxCost = 3\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**  "abc " of s can change to  "bcd ".\nThat costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  "abcd ", t =  "cdef ", maxCost = 3\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  "abcd ", t =  "acde ", maxCost = 0\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `t.length == s.length`\n*   `0 <= maxCost <= 106`\n*   `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.\nonly provide python code\nHere is the solution class:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n']

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of a substring that can be changed within the given cost. The `left` pointer marks the start of the current window, and the `right` pointer marks the end. The `current_cost` keeps track of the total cost of changing the characters in the current window. If the `current_cost` exceeds `maxCost`, the `left` pointer is moved to the right to reduce the cost until it is within the allowed limit. The `max_length` is updated with the maximum window size found during the iteration. 93%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž| 28/30 [06:25<00:31, 15.60s/it]

The player can move up, down, left, right in `grid` if it is a floor (empty cell).\n*   The character `\'.\'` represents the floor which means a free cell to walk.\n*   The character `\'#\'` represents the wall which means an obstacle (impossible to walk there).\n*   There is only one box `\'B\'` and one target cell `\'T\'` in the `grid`.\n*   The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box.

```

This implementation works as follows:

1. The `__init__` method initializes the object with the given array `nums`.

2. The `pick` method takes a `target` number as input and returns a random index where the element in `nums` is equal to the target.

3. Inside the `pick` method, we create a list of indices (`indices`) where the elements in `nums` are equal to the target.

4. We then use `random.choice` to select a random index from the list of indices and return it.

This approach ensures that each valid index has an equal probability of being returned.

['<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, You are a helpful assistant for code generation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow it\'s your turn\ngenerate python code for the following leetcode question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.\n\n**Method read4:**\n\nThe API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.\n\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\n\nNote that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.\n\n**Definition of read4:**\n\n    Parameter:  char\\[\\] buf4\n    Returns:    int\n\nbuf4\\[\\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\\[\\].\n\nBelow is a high-level example of how `read4` works:\n\nFile file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to \'a\' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to \'e\' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`\n\n**Method read:**\n\nBy using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.\n\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\n\n**Definition of read:**\n\n    Parameters:\tchar\\[\\] buf, int n\n    Returns:\tint\n\nbuf\\[\\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\\[\\].\n\n**Note:**\n\n*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.\n*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.\n*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.\n*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.\n*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** file =  "abc ", queries = \\[1,2,1\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,2,0\\]\n**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:\nFile file( "abc ");\nSolution sol;\nsol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  "a ". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.\nsol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain  "bc ". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.\nsol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.\nAssume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** file =  "abc ", queries = \\[4,1\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,0\\]\n**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:\nFile file( "abc ");\nSolution sol;\nsol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.\nsol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read.

This solution maintains an internal buffer to store characters read by `read4` and uses it to fulfill the `read` requests. The `__init__` method initializes the buffer and its indices. The `read` method reads characters from the buffer or calls `read4` to fill the buffer when necessary, ensuring that the requested number of characters is returned.
