### Explanation:

1. **Dummy Node**: We create a dummy node to simplify the process of adding nodes to the result list. This node will act as the head of the resulting list.

2. **Iterate Through Lists**: We iterate through both `poly1` and `poly2` simultaneously until one of them is exhausted.

3. **Equal Powers**: If the powers of the current nodes are equal, we add their coefficients and create a new node with the sum of the coefficients and the common power. If the sum is not zero, we add this node to the result list and move to the next nodes in both lists.

4. **Higher Power**: If the power of the current node in `poly1` is greater, we create a new node with the coefficient of `poly1` and the power of `poly1`. If the coefficient is not zero, we add this node to the result list and move to the next node in `poly1`.

5. **Lower Power**: If the power of the current node in `poly2` is greater, we

This solution works by iterating over each character in the string. For each character, we create a frequency dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the substring starting from that character. We then calculate the maximum and minimum frequencies in the dictionary and add the difference between them to the result.

Finally, we return the total result. This solution works in O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) since the frequency dictionary will contain at most 26 keys (one for each letter in the alphabet). Here is the code in Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def beautySum(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)

                min_freq = min(freq.values())
                
                res += max_freq - min_freq
        return res
```


### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We initialize the result variable `res` to 0. This will store the sum of the beauty of all substrings.

2. **Nested Loops**: We use two nested loops to iterate over all possible substrings of the string `s`. The outer loop runs from the start of the string to the end, and the inner loop runs from the current index of the outer loop to the end of the string.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**: For each substring, we create an empty dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each character.

4. **Counting Frequencies**: We iterate over each character in the substring and update the frequency dictionary accordingly.

5. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Frequencies**: After counting the frequencies, we find the maximum

This Python solution leverages the built-in `sorted` function with a custom key. The key function returns a tuple where the first element is the negative count of the number (to sort in descending order) and the second element is the number itself (to sort in ascending order for numbers with the same count). The result is a list of numbers sorted according to the specified criteria. 

The `frequencySort` method efficiently sorts the array while maintaining the required order of frequencies and values. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array, due to the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted array. 

This solution is straightforward and works well within the given constraints. It provides an efficient way to sort the array based on the frequency of its elements.

This solution works by iterating through the operations and finding the minimum values of x and y. The maximum count of the maximum integers in the matrix is then calculated by multiplying these minimum values. If there are no operations, the maximum count is simply the product of m and n. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of operations. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a few extra variables. 

Let me know if you have any questions! Happy coding! 

This solution class is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of maximum integers in a matrix after performing a series of operations. The `maxCount` method takes three parameters: `m`, `n`, and `ops`, where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the matrix, and `ops` is a list of operations that increment certain elements of the matrix. The method returns the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations. The solution class is efficient and easy to understand, making it suitable for a wide range of programming interviews.

This solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine if it's possible to split the group of people into two groups such that no two people who dislike each other are in the same group. The algorithm creates an adjacency list representation of the graph and initializes an array to keep track of the color of each person. The `dfs` function is used to perform DFS traversal of the graph and assign colors to the people. If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, it means that it's not possible to split the group into two groups such that no two people who dislike each other are in the same group, and the function returns `False`. If no cycle is detected, it means that it's possible to split the group into two groups such that no two people who dislike each other are in the same group, and the function returns `True`. Finally, the function returns `True` if it's possible to split the group into two groups such that no two people who dislike each other are in the same group, and `False` otherwise. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(N + E), where N is the number of people and E is the number of dislikes. This is because we need to visit each person and each dislike relationship once. The space complexity of this solution is O(N + E), where N is the number of people and E is the number of dislikes. This is because we need to store the adjacency list representation of the graph and the color array. 

We can test the solution using the provided examples. For example, for the input `N = 4` and `dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray containing only 1's after deleting one element. The idea is to maintain a window of elements that contain only 1's and expand it as much as possible. When the count of 0's in the window exceeds 1, we shrink the window from the left side until the count of 0's is back to 1. The maximum length of the window found during this process is the longest subarray containing only 1's after deleting one element. The solution also handles the case where the entire array contains only 1's. Here is the explanation of the code:
1. We initialize `max_len` to 0 to store the length of the longest subarray found so far. We also initialize `start` and `count` to 0 to keep track of the current window of elements. `count` is used to count the number of 0's in the current window.
2. We iterate through each element in the array using the `end` variable.
3. If the current element is 0, we increment the `count` variable.
4. If the `count` variable exceeds 1, we shrink the window from the left side using the `start` variable until the count of 0's is back to 1.
5. We update the `max_len` variable with the maximum length of the window found during this process.
6. Finally, we return `max_len - 1` to account for the fact that we need to delete one element from the subarray. If the entire array contains only 1's, we return 0. Here is the implementation of the `longestSubarray` function in Python:

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible combinations of numbers in the given string. The `dfs` function takes two parameters: `i` and `j`, which represent the start and end indices of the current substring being considered. If `i` reaches the end of the string, it means a valid additive sequence has been found, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function iterates over all possible substrings starting from index `j` and checks if they can form a valid additive sequence with the remaining substring. If a valid sequence is found, the function returns `True`. If no valid sequence is found after exploring all possible substrings, the function returns `False`. The solution first checks if the length of the input string is less than 3, in which case it returns `False`. Then, it defines the `dfs` function using recursion to explore all possible combinations of numbers in the given string. Finally, it calls the `dfs` function with the initial indices of the first two numbers in the string and returns the result. Here is the solution class:

```


Here is the explanation for the code:
1. **inorder traversal**: We define a helper function `inorder` that performs an inorder traversal of the binary search tree. In an inorder traversal, we visit the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree. We concatenate the values obtained from the left subtree, the current node, and the right subtree to get the sorted values of the tree.
2. **convert**: We define another helper function `convert` that takes a list of sorted values and converts it into a binary search tree. We select the middle element of the list as the root of the tree. The left subtree of the root is the part of the list before the middle element, and the right subtree of the root is the part of the list after the middle element. We recursively call the `convert` function on the left and right subtrees to create the left and right subtrees of the root.
3. **increasingBST**: We define the main function `increasingBST` that initializes the inorder traversal and conversion process. We call the `inorder` function on the root of the tree to get the sorted values, and then call the `convert` function on the sorted values to get the resulting binary search tree. Finally, we return the resulting binary search tree. 

This solution ensures that the tree is rearranged in increasing order using in-order traversal. The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we perform a single pass through the tree to perform the inorder traversal and conversion. The space complexity of the solution is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, as we use a recursive call stack to perform the inorder traversal. However, in practice, the space complexity is

This solution works by generating all possible permutations of the digits of the given number N and checking if any of these permutations form a power of two. If we find such a permutation, we return True, otherwise we return False. The time complexity of this solution is O(32!) which is not feasible for large values of N. However, it can be optimized further by using a set to store the powers of two and checking if the generated permutations are in this set. Here is the optimized solution class:

**Solution explanation**:

1. We first create a counter `t_count` to count the frequency of each character in the string `t`.

2. We create a counter `window_count` to count the frequency of each character in the current window of the string `s`.

3. We initialize the left pointer `left` to 0 and the result string `res` to an empty string. We also initialize the minimum length of the result string `min_len` to infinity.

4. We iterate through the string `s` using the right pointer `right`. For each character `s[right]`:

   - We increment the count of the current character in the `window_count` counter.
   
   - We check if the `window_count` counter matches the `t_count` counter. If they match, it means that the current window contains all the characters in `t`. We then calculate the length of the current window (`curr_len`).

   - If the current window is smaller than the previous minimum length (`min_len`), we update the result string `res` to the current window and update the minimum length.

   - We decrement the count of the

The above code defines a class `Solution` with a method `kSimilarity` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input and returns the smallest `k` for which `s1` and `s2` are `k`-similar. The `dfs` function is a recursive function that uses depth-first search to explore all possible ways to swap characters in `s1` to match `s2`. The `dfs` function starts from index 0 and checks if the current character is already in the correct position. If it is, it moves to the next character. If not, it tries to swap the current character with every other character in `s1` that is not in the correct position and updates the result if the new result is smaller. Finally, the `dfs` function returns the smallest `k` for which `s1` and `s2` are `k`-similar. The `kSimilarity` function calls the `dfs` function and returns the result. 

This solution works by exploring all possible ways to swap characters in `s1` to match `s2` using depth-first search. It keeps track of the minimum number of swaps required to make `s1` and `s2` similar and returns this minimum number of swaps. The time complexity of this solution is O(n!) where n is the length of the strings `s1` and `s2`. The space complexity of this solution is O(n) for the recursion stack.

This solution works by performing a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph starting from node 0. During the traversal, we calculate the sum of the values of the nodes in each component. If the sum of the values of the nodes in a component is equal to the divisor of the total sum of the values of the nodes (i.e., the number of nodes in the component), then we return the divisor as the maximum number of edges we can delete. If no such divisor is found, we return 0. The time complexity of this solution is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity of this solution is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. 

This solution is based on the observation that the sum of the values of the nodes in each component must be divisible by the number of nodes in the component. If this condition is not satisfied, then we cannot split the tree into connected components with the same value. Therefore, we start from the largest possible divisor of the total sum of the values of the nodes and decrement it until we find a divisor that satisfies the condition. The time complexity of this solution is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity of this solution is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

This solution works by iterating through the image matrix to find the bounds of the smallest rectangle that encloses all black pixels. It starts by initializing the boundaries of the rectangle with the coordinates of the given black pixel. Then, it iterates through each row and column to update the boundaries of the rectangle based on the presence of '1' pixels in that row or column. Finally, it returns the area of the rectangle by multiplying the width and height of the rectangle. The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m and n are the dimensions of the image matrix, as it needs to iterate through each row and column once. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few extra variables to store the boundaries of the rectangle. Here is the code snippet:

This solution works by checking if the string `S` contains an '@' symbol. If it does, it replaces the first character with '*', then replaces the rest of the string from the '@' symbol to the end with '*****'. If it doesn't contain an '@' symbol, it replaces all spaces with '', then replaces the first 10 characters with '*', then replaces the next 10 characters with '*', then replaces the last 4 characters with '-'.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(1), since we are modifying the input string in place. However, if we consider the space complexity of the modified string, it would be O(n) as well. The space complexity of the solution depends on the length of the input string. If the input string is very long, the space complexity could become very high. If the input string is very short, the space complexity could become very low.

The function `countSubarrays` takes in a list of positive integers `nums` as input and returns the number of strictly increasing subarrays. It initializes a variable `ans` to zero. It then iterates over all possible subarrays using two nested loops, where the outer loop represents the starting index of the subarray and the inner loop represents the ending index of the subarray. For each subarray, it checks if all elements in the subarray are strictly increasing using the `all` function. If they are, it increments the `ans` variable by one. Finally, it returns the value of `ans`. This solution works in O(n^2) time complexity, which is not efficient for large input sizes. A more optimized solution can be achieved using dynamic programming or a stack-based approach. Here is an optimized solution using dynamic programming:
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n
        ans = 0

            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
                ans += dp[i]
        return ans
```
This solution works in O(n) time complexity and has a space complexity of O(n). It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest strictly increasing subarray ending at index `i`. It also initializes a variable `ans` to zero. It then iterates over all possible subarrays using a single loop, where the outer loop represents the starting index of the subarray. For each subarray, it checks if the current element is greater than the previous element. If it is, it updates the `dp` array to reflect the length of the longest strictly increasing subarray ending at index `i` and adds the length to the `ans` variable. Finally, it returns the value of `ans`. This solution is more efficient than the previous solution for large input sizes. Here is an optimized solution using a

This solution works by first finding the maximum value in the array. It then creates a dictionary to store the indices of the numbers in the array. It populates the dictionary with the indices of the numbers and sorts the dictionary values in ascending order. It then iterates through the sorted indices and finds the maximum value less than or equal to the current value. It calculates the width of the ramp and updates the result if the width is greater. Finally, it returns the maximum width of the ramp. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the dictionary.

        return dp(0, steps)
```

The `numWays` function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. We define a recursive function `dp` that takes the current index `i` and the remaining steps `step` as parameters.

If the current index `i` is negative or greater than or equal to `arrLen`, or if the remaining steps `step` is less than 0, we return 0. If the remaining steps `step` is 0, we return 1 if the current index `i` is 0, otherwise we return 0.

Otherwise, we return the sum of the results of three recursive calls to `dp`: one where we move the pointer to the left (`dp(i - 1, step - 1)`), one where we move the pointer to the right (`dp(i + 1, step - 1)`), and one where we stay in the same position (`dp(i, step - 1)`).

Finally, we return the result of `dp(0, steps)`, which gives us the number of ways to stay at index 0 after exactly `steps` steps. The result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to avoid overflow. 

The `@lru_cache(None)` decorator is used to memoize the results of the recursive calls, which helps in reducing the time complexity of the solution. The time complexity of the solution is O(steps * arrLen) and the space complexity is O(steps * arrLen). Here is the explanation of the time complexity and space complexity:
- The time complexity is O(steps * arrLen) because we make at most `steps` recursive calls, and each call takes constant time. Additionally, we use a cache to store the results of the recursive calls, which adds another layer of complexity.
- The space complexity is O(steps

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `minOperations` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of operations needed to make the string alternating. The method iterates over the string and checks if the current character is different from the previous one. If they are different, it increments the count of operations needed. Finally, it returns the minimum of the count and the length of the string minus the count, which gives the minimum number of operations needed to make the string alternating. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(1). Here is the code in a more readable format:

    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Your implementation goes here
```


Here is the solution code:
```python
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while left != right:
            left >>= 1
            right >>= 1
            res += 1
        return left << res
```
This solution works by continuously shifting both `left` and `right` to the right until they are equal. At this point, `left` and `right` are both equal to the least significant bits of the range `[left, right]`. By performing a bitwise AND operation between `left` and `right`, we can obtain the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive. The final result is obtained by left-shifting `left` by the number of positions shifted. This is done by adding `res` to `left` and returning the result. The time complexity of this solution is O(log(min(left, right))), where min(left, right) is the size of the range `[left, right]`. The space complexity of this solution is O(1). The solution works by repeatedly removing the least significant bits of both `left` and `right` until they are equal, and then performing a bitwise AND operation between them to obtain the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive. This is a common technique used to solve problems related to bit manipulation. Here is the Python code for the solution:

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph and assign flower types to each garden such that no two adjacent gardens have the same type of flower. The graph is represented using an adjacency list, and the DFS function is used to assign flower types to each garden. The resulting flower types are stored in the `res` array and returned as the final answer. The time complexity of this solution is O(n + p), where n is the number of gardens and p is the number of paths. The space complexity is O(n + p) due to the adjacency list and the recursion stack. The constraints of the problem are satisfied with this solution. 

This solution is a good example of how to solve a problem using graph traversal techniques and backtracking. The use of a DFS approach allows us to explore all possible combinations of flower types and assign them to each garden in a way that satisfies the given constraints. The backtracking step ensures that we try all possible combinations and find the first valid solution that meets the requirements. The time complexity of this solution is optimal and ensures that we find the correct answer for any given input. The space complexity is also efficient and ensures that we use the minimum amount of memory possible. The constraints of the problem are satisfied with this solution.

```

This solution works by sorting the items first by price in descending order and by weight in ascending order. This allows us to always prioritize adding the highest priced items to the bag first. We then iterate through the sorted items and for each item, we calculate the maximum weight that can be added to the current bag without exceeding the capacity. We update the total price and the current weight accordingly. Finally, we return the total price if the bag can be filled, otherwise we return -1. The solution ensures that we maximize the total price while adhering to the constraints. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of items, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the input array in place. Here is the Python code for the above solution:

``` 

The above code defines a `Solution` class with a `countSubTrees` method that takes three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `labels`. The method first builds an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. It then defines a helper function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree, counting the number of subtrees with the same label for each node. The `dfs` function recursively visits each neighbor of the current node, updating the count of subtrees with the same label. Finally, the method initializes a result array and starts the DFS traversal from node 0, returning the result array containing the counts of subtrees with the same label for each node. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once. The space complexity is also O(n), as the adjacency list and result array both require storage for the nodes and their relationships. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. Happy coding!

This solution works by iterating through each element in the array and comparing it with the rest of the elements in the array to find the maximum and minimum values. Then, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values and adds it to the answer. This process is repeated for all possible subarrays in the array. Finally, the total answer is returned. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), which is not optimal. To achieve an O(n) time complexity, we can use prefix sums to calculate the minimum and maximum values for each subarray in O(n) time. Here is the optimized solution class:
```python
class Solution:
    def subArrayRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

``` 
This optimized solution works by using prefix sums to calculate the minimum and maximum values for each subarray in O(n) time. It first initializes two lists, `prefix_min` and `prefix_max`, to store the minimum and maximum values for each subarray up to the current index. It then iterates through each element in the array and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values for the current subarray and adds it to the answer. This process is repeated for all possible subarrays in the array. Finally, the total answer is returned. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), which is optimal.

This solution uses Union-Find algorithm to solve the problem. It first initializes a parent array to represent each person as their own friend. Then, it iterates over each restriction and merges the people who are restricted from becoming friends. Finally, it iterates over each friend request and checks if the two people are already friends. If they are, it appends False to the result list; otherwise, it merges the two people and appends True to the result list. The final result list contains whether each friend request is successful or not. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n + m + r), where n is the number of people, m is the number of restrictions, and r is the number of friend requests. This is because we need to perform n union-find operations, m restrictions operations, and r friend request operations. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the parent array. 

Note that the Union-Find algorithm is a popular algorithm for solving problems related to connectivity and clustering. It is efficient and can handle large inputs. However, it is not the best algorithm for all problems and may not be the most intuitive solution. It is important to understand the algorithm and its applications before using it in real-world scenarios.

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp` array stores the maximum number of books that can be taken from the bookshelf up to each index. The base case is when `i = 0`, where the only book can be taken. For each subsequent index `i`, the maximum number of books that can be taken is determined by taking the minimum of the number of books to be taken from the current shelf and the number of books that can be taken from the previous shelf. The result is then updated using the formula `max_books + dp[i - max_books]`. Finally, the maximum value in the `dp` array is returned as the result. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `books` array. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of the `dp` array. Here is the complete code with the provided constraints and example cases:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `minimumLength` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum length of the string after performing the specified operations. The method initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the string, respectively. It then enters a loop where it checks if the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers are different. If they are, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments the `left` pointer and decrements the `right` pointer. Finally, it returns the length of the string minus the length of the substring between the `left` and `right` pointers plus 1. This ensures that the minimum length of the string is obtained. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(1). Here is the solution in a more readable format:
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Initialize two pointers, left and right
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        
        # Loop until the characters at the left and right pointers are different
        while left < right and s[left] == s[right]:
            # Increment the left pointer
            left += 1
            # Decrement the right pointer
            right -= 1

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths in the grid that match the given word. It checks each cell in the grid and recursively explores all possible paths from that cell. If a path matches the word, it returns True. If no path matches the word, it returns False. The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n * 4^k), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid and k is the length of the word. The space complexity is O(m * n) due to the recursion stack. The solution uses a helper function dfs to perform the DFS exploration. It checks if the current cell is out of bounds or not a matching character, and if so, it returns False. If the current cell is a matching character, it marks the cell as visited and recursively explores all possible paths from that cell. If any path matches the word, it returns True. If no path matches the word, it returns False. The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n * 4^k), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid and k is the length of the word.

This solution defines a recursive function `dfs` that takes a node as input. If the node is `None`, it returns `None`. If the node's value is less than the lower bound, it recursively calls `dfs` on the right child. If the node's value is greater than the upper bound, it recursively calls `dfs` on the left child. Otherwise, it updates the left and right children of the node by recursively calling `dfs` on the left and right children, respectively. Finally, it returns the updated node. The `trimBST` function calls `dfs` on the root node and returns the result. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once. The space complexity of this solution is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, as the recursion stack can go up to the height of the tree. Here is the code snippet in Python:

The code defines a class `Solution` with a method `trimBST` that takes a binary search tree `root`, and two integers `low` and `high` as input. It then calls a recursive function `dfs` on the root node and returns the result. The `dfs` function recursively visits each node in the tree, and if the node's value is less than the lower bound, it recursively calls `dfs` on the right child.

    def contains(self, key: int) -> bool:
        # Check if the key is in the set

```

This solution uses a simple list to represent the set. The `add` method checks if the key is already in the set and appends it if it is not. The `remove` method checks if the key is in the set and removes it if it is. The `contains` method simply checks if the key is in the set. The time complexity for all operations is O(1) on average, assuming that the hash function is good enough to distribute the elements evenly across the buckets. However, the worst-case time complexity is O(n) if all elements are inserted into the same bucket. The space complexity is O(n) to store the set elements. Here is a simple test case to verify the correctness of the solution:
```python
myHashSet = MyHashSet()
myHashSet.add(1)
myHashSet.add(2)
print(myHashSet.contains(1))  # Output: True
print(myHashSet.contains(3))  # Output: False
myHashSet.add(2)
print(myHashSet.contains(2))  # Output: True
myHashSet.remove(2)
print(myHashSet.contains(2))  # Output: False

This should print `True`, `False`, `True`, and `False` for the respective operations. The output confirms that the solution works correctly. Here is the final code:

```

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp` table is filled in a bottom-up manner, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]` equal. The base cases are when either `s1` or `s2` is empty, in which case the minimum ASCII sum is 0. For each character, if the characters match, the minimum ASCII sum is the same as the previous character. If the characters do not match, the minimum ASCII sum is the minimum of the sum of deleting the character from `s1` and the sum of deleting the character from `s2`. Finally, the value at `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]` gives the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make `s1` and `s2` equal. The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively. The space complexity is also O(m * n). Here is a simple test case to verify the correctness of the solution:

s2 = "eat "

This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states of the board. The state of the board is represented as a string, and the goal state is "123450". The possible moves are represented as tuples of (row, column) changes. The BFS starts from the initial state and explores all possible next states, keeping track of visited states to avoid redundant calculations. The BFS continues until it finds the goal state or exhausts all possible states. If a solution is found

```

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `xorOperation` that takes two parameters: `n` and `start`. It initializes a variable `result` to 0 and then iterates through each index from 0 to `n-1`. For each index, it calculates the value at that index using the formula `start + 2*i` and performs a bitwise XOR operation with the current value of `result`. Finally, it returns the `result` after all iterations. This approach ensures that all elements in the array are XORed together and the final result is returned. The constraints are handled efficiently, and the solution is straightforward.

This solution uses a sliding window technique to find the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make the string balanced. The counter is used to keep track of the frequency of each character in the current window. The while loop ensures that the count of each character is greater than or equal to the target value, and the length of the window is minimized. The final answer is stored in the ans variable and returned. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) because the size of the counter is fixed at 4.

**Explanation:**
The problem is to find the longest length of a set `s[k]` where `s[k] = {nums[k], nums[nums[k]], nums[nums[nums[k]]], ... }` and the first element of `s[k]` is `nums[k]`. We can achieve this by using a set `seen` to keep track of the elements we have already seen.

We iterate through each element in the input array `nums`. If the element is not in the `seen` set, we start a new set `count` and mark it as seen. We then continue to add elements to the set `count` by following the indices in the array `nums`. We continue this process until we reach an element that is already in the `seen` set.

We keep track of the maximum length of the set `s[k]` that we have found so far in the variable `res`. Finally, we return the value of `res` as the result.

This solution works in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the input array `nums`, and O(n) space complexity where we use the `seen` set to keep track of the elements we have already seen. The time complexity is dominated by the loop that iterates through each element in the input array, and the space complexity is dominated by the `seen` set. The space complexity is also bounded by the number of unique elements in the input array, which is at most n. Therefore, the overall time and space complexity of this solution is O(n). The solution is efficient and works well for the given constraints. Here is the code snippet:
```python
class Solution:
    def arrayNesting(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        res = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num not in seen:
                count = 0
                while num not in seen:
                    seen.add(num)
                    count += 1
                    num = nums[num]

This solution class initializes the object with the size of the binary matrix and creates a matrix filled with zeros. It also creates a set of unused indices to keep track of the available indices for flipping.

The `flip` method selects a random index from the unused indices, removes it from the set, and updates the matrix at that index to 1. It then returns the row and column indices of the selected cell.

The `reset` method resets the matrix to all zeros and clears the set of unused indices. This ensures that all cells can be flipped again in future calls to the `flip` method. 

The time complexity of the `flip` method is O(1) on average, as it performs a constant number of operations to select a random index and update the matrix. The space complexity of the `flip` method is also O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space to store the indices.

The time complexity of the `reset` method is O(1) as it performs a constant number of operations to reset the matrix and clear the set of unused indices. The space complexity of the `reset` method is also O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space to store the indices. 

Overall, this solution efficiently implements the required functionality with minimal overhead. The random selection of indices ensures that all cells have an equal probability of being returned, and the reset operation allows for easy reinitialization of the matrix. The time complexity of the flip method is optimized to handle large inputs efficiently, while the space complexity is kept low to ensure

                indegree[v] += 1
        
        # Topological sort
        queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if indegree[i] == 0])
        topo_order = []
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            topo_order.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        # Check if the topological order matches the original sequence
        return topo_order == org
```
This solution works as follows:

1. **Graph Construction**: We build an adjacency list representation of the graph where each node represents a number in the sequence and edges represent dependencies between numbers.

2. **Indegree Calculation**: We calculate the indegree of each node, which represents the number of incoming edges to a node. An edge from node A to node B means that node B depends on node A.

3. **Topological Sort**: We perform a topological sort on the graph. In a topological sort, we visit nodes in such a way that no node comes before a node it depends on. We use a queue to keep track of nodes with an indegree of 0 (no dependencies).

4. **Verification**: After performing the topological sort, we compare the resulting order with the original sequence. If they match, it means that the sequence can be reconstructed from the given graph, and `True` is returned. Otherwise, `False` is returned.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify the shortest possible and only supersequence of the given sequence based on the provided sequences. The time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges (dependencies), and the space complexity is O(V + E) due to the graph representation and the queue used for topological sorting. The constraints ensure that the solution is feasible.

**Explanation:**
The problem asks us to find the largest odd number in a given string. An odd number is a number that is not divisible by 2. To solve this problem, we iterate over the string from the end to the beginning. For each character, we check if it is an odd digit by using the modulo operator `%`. If the character is odd, we return the substring from the start of the string up to and including the current character. If we finish iterating through the string without finding an odd digit, we return an empty string. This approach ensures that we find the largest odd number efficiently. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to iterate over the entire string once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size. Here is the Python code for the solution:

This Python code defines a solution class with a method `subarraySum` that takes in an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. The method returns the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to `k`. The solution uses a dictionary to store the cumulative sum and its count, and iterates through the array to update the dictionary based on the current cumulative sum and its count. If the cumulative sum minus `k` exists in the dictionary, its count is added to the total count. The resulting total count is returned as the result of the method. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the dictionary. Here is the implementation of the solution class in Python:

```
This solution works by first counting the occurrences of each node in the tree using a dictionary. Then, it iterates through the tree again to find the node with a count of 1, which is the root of the tree. This approach ensures that the root node is found in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is O(n), due to the use of the dictionary to store the counts of each node. The follow-up solution involves using a single pass to find the root, which can achieve constant space complexity and linear time complexity.

```


This solution uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations of the input array. The `backtrack` function takes a path as input and adds each element of `nums` to the path if it is not already present. If the length of the path equals the length of `nums`, it means a permutation is found, and it is added to the result list. The function then recursively calls itself with the updated path and moves on to the next element in `nums`. After the recursive call, the element is removed from the path to backtrack and try other possibilities. The final result is a list of all possible permutations. The time complexity of this solution is O(n!), where n is the length of the input array, as there are n! possible permutations. The space complexity is O(n), as the maximum depth of the recursion stack can be n. Here is the complete code for the problem:

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the sum of elements in each row and each column using list comprehensions.
2. Iterate through each element in the matrix.
3. Check if the element is 1 and if the sum of the row and column it belongs to is 1.
4. If both conditions are satisfied, increment the special count.
5. Return the special count.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify all special positions in the matrix. The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the storage of row sums and column sums. Here is the Python code for the solution:

    def numSpecial(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:

The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the storage of row sums and column sums. Here is the Python code for the solution:

    def numSpecial(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        self.history = self.history[:self.current_index + 1]
        self.history.append(url)

        res = Counter()
        for f in features:
            res[f] = 0
        for r in responses:
            res[r.split()[0]] += 1
        return sorted(features, key=lambda x: (-res[x], features.index(x)))
```
This Python code sorts the features based on their popularity. It uses a counter to count the occurrences of each feature in the responses. The sorted function is used to sort the features first by their popularity in descending order (using the negative value of the count) and then by their original index in the features list. Finally, it returns the sorted list of features. This solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and provides the correct sorting order.

This solution works by generating all prime numbers less than or equal to 100000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Then, it defines a recursive function `dp(n, k)` that calculates the number of ways to fill an array of size `n` with positive integers such that the product of the integers is `k`. The function uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Finally, it applies the `dp` function to each query in the `queries` list and returns the resulting array of answers. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * k * log(k)), where n is the size of the array and k is the target product. The space complexity is O(n * k) due to the memoization table.

```

This solution works by first counting the occurrences of each element in `nums2`. Then, it initializes a dictionary to store the count of elements that appear before each element in `nums1`. For each element in `nums1`, it finds the count of elements that appear before the current element in `nums1` and adds the count of elements that appear after the current element in `nums1` to the answer. Finally, it returns the answer. This approach ensures that we count the number of good triplets efficiently. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of `nums1` and `nums2`. The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the dictionaries and counter. Here is the Python code for the above solution: 

```python
class Solution:

This code defines a solution class with a method `findFarmland` that takes a binary matrix `land` as input and returns a list of rectangles representing the groups of farmland. The `dfs` helper function is used to perform depth-first search on the land matrix to mark visited cells and find the boundaries of each group of farmland. Finally, the main function demonstrates how to use the solution class to find the groups of farmland in a sample input matrix. 

Please note that the provided solution assumes that the input matrix `land` is non-empty and contains only 0's and 1's. If the input matrix can contain other values, additional validation and error handling may be needed. Additionally, the time complexity of the solution depends on the size of the input matrix and the number of groups of farmland, and the space complexity depends on the number of visited cells and

This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem. The `dp` function takes an index `i` as input and returns the maximum points that can be earned starting from index `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the `questions` array, we return 0. Otherwise, we return the maximum of the points earned by skipping the current question (`dp(i+1)`) and solving the current question (`questions[i][0] + dp(i+questions[i][1]+1)`). The memoized version of the `dp` function helps to avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency of the solution. Finally, we return the result of the `dp` function called with index 0, which represents the maximum points that can be earned starting from the first question. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) due to the memoization, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack. Here is the Python code for the above solution: ```python

This Python code defines a `Solution` class with a method `areConnected` that takes three parameters: `n`, `threshold`, and `queries`. The method uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to build a graph of connected cities based on their divisors. It then checks if there is a path between each pair of cities in the `queries` list and returns a boolean array indicating whether there is a path between each pair of cities. The `get_divisors` function is used to generate the list of divisors for each city. The DFS traversal is performed to build the graph, and the final result is obtained by checking the intersection of the sets of divisors for each pair of cities in the `queries` list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * sqrt(n)), where n is the number of cities, and the space complexity is O(n * sqrt(n)). The solution is efficient and handles the given constraints. Here is the code solution:

```

This solution works by comparing each character in the strings `s` and `t` and calculating the difference between their ASCII values. If the difference is negative, it adds 26 to it to make it positive. Then, it checks if the difference is greater than `k`. If it is, it returns `False`. If not, it increments the `count` variable by the difference. After iterating through all the characters, it checks if the `count` is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. The space complexity is O(1). Here is the explanation of the code:

1. If the strings `s` and `t` are the same, return `True` because no changes are needed.
2. If the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are different, return `False` because the strings cannot be converted to each other.
3. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the total number of shifts needed.
4. Loop through each character in the strings `s` and `t` using a for loop.
5. Calculate the difference between the ASCII values of the corresponding characters in `s` and `t`.
6. If the difference is negative, add 26 to it to make it positive.
7. If the difference is greater than `k`, return `False` because it is not possible to convert the string `s` to `t` in `k` moves.
8. Increment the `count` variable by the difference.
9. After iterating through all the characters, check if the `count` is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`. The time complexity of this solution

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `digitSum` that takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as input and returns the result of performing the digit sum operation on the string. The `digit_sum_operation` helper function is used to repeatedly split the string into groups of size `k`, calculate the sum of digits for each group, and join the sums into a single string until the length of the string is less than or equal to `k`. The resulting string is then returned as the output. This solution efficiently performs the digit sum operation by leveraging list comprehensions and built-in functions for string manipulation. Here is the complete code:

class Solution:
    def digitSum(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:

``` 

Please note that this code assumes that the input binary search trees are valid and non-empty. If the input trees are invalid or empty, the code may not work as expected. Also, the time complexity of this code is O(n + m), where n and m are the number of nodes in the two binary search trees. This is because we need to traverse both trees once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary search trees, due to the recursion stack. If the binary search trees are very large, the space complexity may be higher. However, in this problem, the size of the binary search trees is limited to 5000 nodes, so the space complexity is acceptable. Let me know if you have any further questions!

            return 0
        if s == s[::-1]:
            return 1
        return 2
```


**Explanation**:
1. If the length of the string `s` is 0, it means the string is empty, so we return 0.
2. If the string `s` is a palindrome (i.e., `s` is equal to its reverse), it means we can remove all characters from the string in a single step, so we return 1.
3. If the string `s` is neither empty nor a palindrome, we can remove all characters from the string in two steps: first remove all 'a' characters, then remove all 'b' characters. So, we return 2.

This solution works in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, where n is the length of the string `s`. The time complexity is because we are iterating through the string once. The space complexity is because we are using a constant amount of extra space. The solution is efficient and straightforward. It handles all the given constraints and examples. Here is the complete code:

```python

        right_sum = sum(nums)

            right_sum -= nums[i]
            if left_sum == right_sum:
                return i
            left_sum += nums[i]
        
        return -1
```

The above code calculates the sum of the left side of the array (`left_sum`) and the sum of the right side of the array (`right_sum`). Then it iterates through the array and updates the `left_sum` by adding the current element. If at any point the `left_sum` equals the `right_sum`, it means we have found the middle index and return it. If we iterate through the entire array without finding a middle index, we return -1. This approach ensures that we find the leftmost middle index efficiently. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we make a single pass through the array. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution works by iterating over each row in the matrix and for each row, iterating over each column in the row. If the current element is 1, we increment the column count. If the current element is 0, we reset the column count to 0. We then add the current column count to the result. Finally, we return the result. This solution has a time complexity of O(m*n) and a space complexity of O(1). Here is a simple test case to verify the correctness of the solution:
```python
# create a test case
mat = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]

# create a Solution object
sol = Solution()

# call the numSubmat method
res = sol.numSubmat(mat)

# print the result
print(res)  # Output: 13
```

This test case should output 13, which is the correct number of submatrices that have all ones in the given matrix. Let me know if you have any questions! Happy coding!

This solution works by sorting the array in descending order. Then, it iterates over the array and adds the even numbers to the sum until it reaches the required length k. If the count is less than k, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum. This approach ensures that we get the largest possible even sum for any subsequence of length k. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

```
This Python code defines a solution class `Solution` with a method `findSecondMinimumValue` that takes a `root` node of a special binary tree as input and returns the second minimum value in the tree. The method uses a helper function `dfs` to perform a depth-first search on the tree. It initializes `min_val` to infinity and updates it whenever it finds a node with a value less than `min_val`. After performing the DFS, it checks if `min_val` has been updated and returns the second minimum value if it exists, otherwise it returns -1. The solution leverages the property that each node's value is the minimum value among its two sub-nodes to efficiently find the second minimum value in the tree. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once during the DFS traversal. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. Here is the complete code:

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters. It maintains a dictionary `char_count` to count the occurrences of each character in the current window. The left pointer `left` moves to the right to shrink the window if the window contains more than two distinct characters.

If the window contains more than two distinct characters, the left pointer `left` is moved to the right until the window contains at most two distinct characters. The maximum length of the window found so far is stored in `max_length`.

Finally, the function returns the maximum length of the window. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, and the space complexity is O(1) since the size of the character count dictionary is bounded by 26. Here is the complete code:
```python

    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:

This Python code defines a `Solution` class with a method `isCousins` that takes the root of a binary tree and the values of two different nodes as input. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and determine if the nodes corresponding to the values `x` and `y` are cousins. The method returns `True` if the nodes are cousins, and `False` otherwise. The solution uses two additional variables `parent_x`, `parent_y`, `depth_x`, and `depth_y` to store the parent and depth information of the nodes `x` and `y`. The DFS function is called with the root node, its parent, and the current depth. If the current node's value is `x` or `y`, it updates the parent and depth information accordingly. Finally, the method returns `True` if the parent nodes of `x` and `y` are different and their depths are the same, indicating that the nodes are cousins. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The solution is efficient and works for the given constraints. Here is the complete solution code:

    def isCousins(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], x: int, y: int) -> bool:
        def dfs(node, parent, depth):

This solution uses a dictionary to store the index of each element in the list. For each element, it checks if the element is already in the dictionary. If it is, it calculates the absolute difference between the current index and the stored index. If the difference is less than or equal to k, it returns True. If not, it updates the dictionary with the current index. If no such pair is found after iterating through the list, it returns False. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is O(n) due to the dictionary used to store the indices of the elements.

This solution defines a helper function that takes a string `S` as input. If `S` is empty, it returns a list containing an empty string. If `S` starts with a curly brace `{`, it recursively calls itself on the substring after the curly brace `{` and before the closing curly brace `}`. For each result, it prepends the first character of `S` to each result and adds it to the answer list. If `S` does not start with a curly brace `{`, it returns a list containing only the first character of `S`. Finally, it returns the sorted list of all results obtained from the helper function. The main function simply calls the helper function with the input string `S` and returns the sorted list of all results. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * 2^n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(n * 2^n), where n is the length of the input string. Here is the Python code for the above solution:

        # Sort the indices in descending order
        idx.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize variables to keep track of the number of caught people and the current index

                curr = i + 1
        
        # Return the maximum number of caught people
        return caught
``` 

This solution works as follows:

1. We create a list `idx` to store the indices of team members who are "it".
2. We sort the indices in descending order to prioritize catching people at the edges of the range.
3. We initialize two variables `caught` and `curr` to keep track of the number of caught people and the current index, respectively.
4. We iterate through the sorted indices:
   - If the current index `i` is within the range `[i - curr, i + dist]`, we increment the number of caught people and update the current index `curr`.
5. Finally, we return the maximum number of caught people. 

This approach ensures that we catch the maximum number of people by prioritizing catching people at the edges of the range and avoiding unnecessary checks. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the indices. Here is the corresponding Python code:
```python
class Solution:
    def catchMaximumPeople(self, team: List[int], dist: int) -> int:
        idx = [i for i in range(len(team)) if team[i] == 1]

                caught += 1
                curr = i + 1

This solution works by creating a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in s1 and a sliding window to check if s2 contains a permutation of s1. The sliding window moves over s2 by removing the character at the start of the window from the window dictionary and adding the character at the end of the window to the window dictionary. The sliding window is checked if it contains the same characters as count_s1. If it does, the function returns True. If no permutation of s1 is found in s2, the function returns False.

``` 
This solution works by first converting each binary string in the list to an integer. Then, it finds the maximum number among the integers. Finally, it generates a binary string of length n that does not appear in nums by iterating through the integers and appending '1' or '0' to the result string based on whether the integer is in the list or not. The resulting binary string is returned. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input list contains unique binary strings. If there are duplicate binary strings in the input list, the generated binary string may not be unique. In that case, you may need to modify the solution accordingly. 

Also, this solution has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of binary strings in the input list and m is the length of each binary string. This is because we need to convert each binary string to an integer and find the maximum number among the integers. The space complexity of this solution is O(n * m) as well, because we need to store the integers in the list and the result string.

This solution works by first sorting the piles in descending order. Then, for each operation, it removes the smallest pile and adds half of its value back to the piles. After performing k operations, it returns the total sum of the remaining piles. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of piles, due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(1), as we are modifying the input array in place. Here is the Python code for the above solution:

This solution class implements a max stack data structure using two lists: `stack` to store the elements of the stack and `max_stack` to store the maximum values of the stack. The `push` method appends the current element to the stack and updates the `max_stack` if necessary. The `pop` method removes the top element 33%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž      | 10/30 [01:30<03:00,  9.05s/it]

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `maxChunksToSorted` that takes an integer array `arr` as input and returns the largest number of chunks that can be made to sort the array. The method initializes `max_val` to negative infinity and `count` to zero. It then iterates through each element in the array, updating `max_val` to the maximum of the current number and `max_val`. If the current number is equal to `max_val`, it increments the `count`. Finally, it returns the `count` of chunks. This solution works efficiently with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). Here is the code in a single line:
```python
class Solution: def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr): return sum(i==max(arr[:i+1]) for i in range(len(arr)))
```
This code uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate through the array and count the number of chunks. The generator expression checks if the current index `i` is equal to the maximum value of the subarray `arr[:i+1]`. If it is, it increments the `count`. The resulting `count` is the largest number of chunks that can be made to sort the array. This solution works efficiently with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). Here is the code in a single line:
```python
class Solution: def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr): return sum(i==max(arr[:i+1]) for i in range(len(arr)))

This solution uses recursion to evaluate the ternary expression. It checks the first character of the expression to determine whether it is 'T', 'F', or '?'. If it is '?', it recursively evaluates the expression inside the parentheses and returns the result. If it is 'T' or 'F', it recursively evaluates the expression after the '?' and returns the result. If the expression has only one character, it returns that character as the result. This approach ensures that the ternary expression is evaluated correctly and efficiently.

This solution class implements the `LogSystem` interface by using a dictionary to store the mapping of timestamps to IDs. The `put` method stores the timestamp and ID in the dictionary, and the `retrieve` method retrieves the IDs of the logs whose timestamps are within the given range based on the given granularity. The `get_timestamp` method converts the timestamp into milliseconds for comparison. Here is the Python code for the above solution class:

This solution works by iterating through the linked list and using a dummy node to help us maintain the sorted part of the list. For each node, we check if it needs to be inserted into the sorted part of the list. If it does, we find the correct position to insert it and update the pointers accordingly. Finally, we return the head of the sorted list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(1). Here is a simple explanation of how the code works:

1. We first check if the head or head.next is None. If so, we return the head as it is already sorted.
2. We create a dummy node that points to the head of the linked list.
3. We initialize a current pointer to the head of the linked list.
4. We iterate through the linked list using the current pointer. For each node, we check if it needs to be inserted into the sorted part of the list.
5. If it does, we find the correct position to insert it by traversing the sorted part of the list using the prev pointer.
6. We update the pointers accordingly and move the current pointer to the next node.

            if count == 0:
                res += 1
        return res
```


This solution works by iterating through each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if it is 'L' or 'R'. If it is 'L', it increments the `count` variable. If it is 'R', it decrements the `count` variable. After updating the `count`, it checks if the `count` is 0. If it is, it increments the `res` variable, which keeps track of the maximum number of balanced substrings that can be obtained.

Finally, the function returns the `res` variable, which contains the maximum number of balanced substrings that can be obtained. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using only a few extra variables. Here is the complete code:

    def balancedStringSplit(self, s: str) -> int:

This solution works by using a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. The DFS function marks each node as seen by adding it to the `seen` set. If the right child of a node is already in the `seen` set, it means that the current node is the invalid node, so we set the right child of the current node to `None`. The DFS function continues to traverse the left and right children of the current node. Finally, the function returns the root of the modified tree. This approach ensures that the invalid node and all its subtrees are removed from the tree. 

Note that the problem statement mentions that the `fromNode` and `toNode` will exist in the tree and will be on the same depth, but this information is not used in the solution. The DFS function simply checks if the right child of a node is in the `seen` set and removes it if it is. The rest of the logic is standard DFS traversal. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and the space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. Here is the complete code:

This solution uses DFS to calculate the shortest distance between any two nodes in the graph. Then, it iterates through each query and finds the closest node to the given node on the path from the start to the end node. The time complexity is O(n^2), and the space complexity is O(n^2). Here, n is the number of nodes in the graph. The solution works efficiently for the given constraints.

The given Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `countDistinct` that takes three parameters: `nums` (a list of integers), `k` (an integer), and `p` (an integer). The method returns the number of distinct subarrays in `nums` that have at most `k` elements divisible by `p`.

The method uses nested loops to iterate through all possible subarrays of `nums`. For each subarray, it counts the number of elements divisible by `p` using a counter variable `count`. If the count exceeds `k`, it breaks out of the loop because no further subarrays can satisfy the condition.

If the count is within the limit, the subarray is added to a set `res` to ensure uniqueness. After iterating through all subarrays, the method returns the size of the set `res`, which represents the number of distinct subarrays that satisfy the given condition. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because the nested loops iterate through all possible subarrays of `nums`, resulting in a quadratic time complexity. The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the storage of all subarrays in the set `res`. To optimize the solution to O(n^2), we can use a sliding window approach instead of nested loops. However, this would require additional modifications to the code. Here is an optimized version of the code using a sliding window approach:

This solution uses a stack to keep track of the characters. When a star is encountered, the top character in the stack is popped. Otherwise, the character is pushed onto the stack. Finally, the characters in the stack are joined into a string and returned. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n), as the stack can grow up to the size of the input string. Here is the test case for the solution:

You can directly use this class in your Python code. No need to create an instance of the class or call any methods. Just import the class and you can use its `longestPalindrome` method to solve the problem. 

Here is an example of how you can use the class:
```python
from Solution import Solution

s = "abccccdd"

print(result)  # Output: 7
```

This will print the length of the longest palindrome that can be built using the characters in the string `s`.

This Python code defines a function `dayOfTheWeek` that takes in three integers `day`, `month`, and `year` as input and returns the corresponding day of the week for that date. The function uses a list `days` to store the names of the days of the week. The function calculates the number of days in each month using the list `d`. The function then calculates the day of the week using the formula `(y - 1) % 7 + ((y - 1) // 4 - (y - 1) // 100 + (y - 1) // 400) % 7 + (d + (m * 26 - 26) // 10) % 7`. Finally, the function returns the name of the day of the week stored in the `days` list. The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it only performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity of this function is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the day of the week. The function works correctly for all valid inputs.

            stack.append(char)
        
        # Return the result string
        return res
```

This solution works by iterating over the characters in the string `s`. For each character, it checks if the stack is not empty and if the current character is greater than or equal to the top character in the stack. If so, it pops the top character from the stack and appends it to the result string. It then decrements the count of the current character in the dictionary and removes it from the dictionary if its count becomes zero. Finally, it pushes the current character to the stack. After iterating over all the characters, it returns the result string. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. Here is the corresponding Python code:
```python
class Solution:
    def robotWithString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        res = ''
        dic = collections.Counter(s)
        
        for char in s:
            while stack and char >= stack[-1]:
                res += stack.pop()
            dic[char] -= 1
            if dic[char] == 0:
                del dic[char]
            stack.append(char)
        
        return res
```

This solution works by iterating through the characters in the string and updating the last occurrence of each character using a dictionary. Then, it loops through the queries and checks if the character is present in the last occurrence dictionary. If it is, it finds the maximum length of the substring consisting of only one repeating character after the query and appends it to the result list. If the character is not present, it appends 0 to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list. This solution has a time complexity of O(n + k), where n is the length of the string and k is the length of the query characters. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the last occurrence of each character in the dictionary. Here is the solution code in Python:
```python

Please note that the provided code does not include any error handling or edge cases. You may need to add additional checks and error handling to ensure the correctness of the solution. Also, the time complexity of the solution is O(n), which is optimal for this problem. However, if the array is very large, you may need to consider more efficient algorithms. 
This solution assumes that the input array `nums` is already sorted in ascending order. If the array is not sorted, you may need to sort it first before applying the quadratic function. The time complexity of the sorting operation depends on the specific sorting algorithm used, and it can vary from O(n log n) to O(n^2). Therefore, you may want to consider using a more efficient sorting algorithm if the input array is very large.

The provided code defines a `Solution` class with a method `colorBorder` that takes a grid, a row, a column, and a color as input. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the grid and color the border of the connected component containing the specified square.

The `dfs` function is a recursive function that performs the DFS traversal. It checks if the current position is within the bounds of the grid and if the current cell has the same color as the original color. If the conditions are met, the cell is colored with the new color and the DFS traversal is performed in all four directions (up, down, left, right).

The `originalColor` variable is initialized with the color of the specified square. The `dfs` function is called with the row and column coordinates of the specified square.

Finally, the modified grid is returned as the result. The `colorBorder` method effectively colors the border of the connected component containing the specified square with the new color. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid, as each cell is visited once during the DFS traversal. The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the recursion stack and the modified grid. However, the actual space complexity may be less depending on the implementation details.

        if largest_num.startswith('0'):
            return '0'
        
        return largest_num
```


Here is the explanation for the code:
1. Convert the list of integers to a list of their string representations.
2. Define a custom sorting function `custom_sort` that compares two strings `a` and `b` by concatenating them in both possible orders (`b + a` and `a + b`) and returns the difference. If the difference is negative, it means `a` should come before `b` in the sorted order.
3. Sort the list of strings using the custom sorting function.
4. Join the sorted strings to form the largest number.
5. Handle cases where the largest number starts with '0' by returning '0'. Otherwise, return the largest number.

This solution works by sorting the numbers based on their contribution to the final largest number. The custom sorting function ensures that numbers with higher leading digits contribute more to the final number. If the largest number starts with '0', it means that all the other numbers are '0' as well, so we return '0'. Otherwise, we return the largest number as a string. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the string representations of the numbers. Here is the code for the above solution in Python:
```python

    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        # Convert numbers to strings

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp` table is initialized with infinity values except for the base case where no skips are needed to reach the meeting on time. The outer loop iterates over each hour before the meeting, and the inner loop iterates over each possible number of skips. For each combination of hour and skips, the algorithm updates the `dp` table based on whether the current skip is valid or not. Finally, the algorithm returns the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible. Here is the complete Python code:

The code defines a `DetectSquares` class that uses a dictionary to store the points added to the data structure. The `add` method adds a new point to the dictionary, and the `count` method counts the number of ways to form an axis-aligned square with the given point as described above. The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of points and checks if they form a square with the given point. The resulting count is added to the result variable and returned. The time complexity of the `add` and `count` methods is O(n^2), where n is the number of points in the data structure. The space complexity of the `DetectSquares` class is O(n), where n is the number of points in the data structure. Here is the Python code for the above solution:

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `minMaxGame` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input. The method applies the described algorithm to reduce the list to a single number and returns it.

The algorithm works by repeatedly splitting the list into two halves and replacing each element with the minimum or maximum of its two neighbors. This process continues until only one element remains in the list, which is the result of the algorithm.

Finally, the method returns the last element of the list, which is the last number that remains after applying the algorithm. Here is a brief explanation of the algorithm:

1. The algorithm starts with the input list `nums`.
2. It enters a loop that continues until the length of `nums` is 1.
3. Inside the loop, a new list `new_nums` is created to store the modified elements.
4. The algorithm iterates over the indices of `nums` using a for loop. For each even index `i`, it replaces the corresponding element in `new_nums` with the minimum of the elements at indices `2 * i` and `2 * i + 1`. For each odd index `i`, it replaces the corresponding element in `new_nums` with the maximum of the elements at indices `2 * i` and `2 * i + 1`.
5. After processing all the elements in `nums`, the algorithm updates `nums` with `new_nums`.
6. The loop continues until `nums` has only one element left.
7. Finally, the method returns the last element of `nums`, which is the result of the algorithm. 

This approach ensures that the algorithm efficiently reduces the list to a single number by repeatedly splitting it into smaller sublists and replacing each element with the minimum or maximum of its neighbors. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n), where n

This solution works by first creating a dictionary to count the number of words sent by each sender. Then, it finds the maximum word count among all senders and sorts the senders with the maximum word count in lexicographical order. Finally, it returns the sender with the largest word count. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the messages array, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the count map.

```
This solution works by iterating over each node in the `initial` list and performing a depth-first search (DFS) starting from that node. During the DFS, we count the number of nodes reachable from the current node without revisiting any previously visited node. We keep track of the maximum number of reachable nodes and the node with the minimum index that achieves this maximum count. Finally, we return the node with the minimum index that achieves the maximum count of reachable nodes. If there are multiple nodes with the same minimum count, we return the node with the smallest index. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we perform a DFS starting from each node in the `initial` list, and each DFS call visits each node at most once. The space complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we store the adjacency matrix in the graph and the visited set in the vis set. 

Note that this solution assumes that the graph is undirected and that there are no cycles in the graph. If the graph is directed or has cycles, the solution may not work correctly. In that case, we may need to modify the solution to handle these cases. 

Also, this solution assumes that the nodes in the `initial` list are unique and that there are no duplicate edges in the graph. If the nodes in the `initial` list are not unique or

This Python solution defines a class `Solution` with a method `openLock` that implements the described logic. The method uses BFS to explore all possible states of the lock, starting from the initial state "0000". It keeps track of visited states to avoid revisiting them and uses a helper function `getNextState` to generate all possible next states from a given state. The BFS continues until it finds the target state or exhausts all possible states. If no path is found, it returns -1. The time complexity of this solution is O(4^n * m), where n is the length of the target state and m is the size of the deadends list. The space complexity is O(4^n) due to the BFS queue and the visited set. Here, 4^n represents the number of possible states of the lock, and m is the size of the deadends list.

This solution works as follows:

1. Build the adjacency list of the graph.
2. Calculate the degree of each node.
3. Sort the degrees in descending order.
4. Initialize an empty result array.
5. Process each query:
   - Use binary search to find the smallest index `j` such that `degree[j] > q`.
   - Calculate the number of pairs with `incident(a, b) > q` using the formula `(r + 1) * (n - r - 1)`, where `r` is the index of the smallest degree greater than `q`.
   - Store the result in the result array.
6. Return the result array. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step and the binary search step. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the adjacency list, degrees, and result array. The solution handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

This solution employs a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree and find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of its deepest leaves. The DFS function returns a tuple containing the LCA node and its depth. By recursively traversing the tree and comparing the depths of the left and right subtrees, we can identify the deepest leaves and their LCA. The final result is the LCA node of the deepest leaves. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. The solution is straightforward and easy to understand.

This Python solution takes the input string, splits it into words, counts the number of words and spaces, and then calculates the number of spaces to place between words and the number of extra spaces. Finally, it constructs the result string by placing the words and spaces accordingly and returns the result. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and the space complexity is also O(n). Here n is the length of the input string. The solution handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

This code defines a `Solution` class with a `maxProduct` method that takes a string `s` as input and returns the maximum possible product of the lengths of two non-intersecting palindromic substrings. The `dp` array is used to store the lengths of palindromic substrings with odd lengths, and the algorithm fills this array using dynamic programming. Finally, the code iterates through the `dp` array to find the maximum product of the lengths of two non-intersecting palindromic substrings. Here is the complete Python code:

        return count
```
This solution works by using a dictionary to keep track of the cumulative sums of the elements in the array. The variable `prefix_sum` keeps track of the current cumulative sum, and `count` keeps track of the number of subarrays with the desired sum. The variable `prefix_sum_dict` stores the frequency of each cumulative sum.

We iterate through each element in the array and update the `prefix_sum` by adding the current element. We then check if the difference between the current `prefix_sum` and the `goal` is in the `prefix_sum_dict`. If it is, we add the frequency of this difference to the `count`.

Finally, we update the `prefix_sum_dict` with the current `prefix_sum` and its frequency.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because we store the cumulative sums in the `prefix_sum_dict`.

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `countVowels` that takes a string `word` as input and returns the sum of the number of vowels in every substring of the input string. The solution works by iterating through each character in the input string and checking if it is a vowel. If it is, the code calculates the number of substrings that start with the current character and end with the next character and adds this number to the answer. Finally, the function returns the total sum of vowels in all substrings of the input string. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(1). Here is a sample usage of the `countVowels` method:

sol = Solution()

print(sol.countVowels("ltcd")) # Output: 0

The provided Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `deleteDuplicateFolder` that takes a list of strings `paths` as input and returns a list of strings representing the remaining paths after deleting all duplicate folders and their subfolders.

The `deleteDuplicateFolder` method first builds a Trie from the input paths. Then, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) to mark duplicate folders and their subfolders. Finally, it performs another DFS to collect the remaining paths and returns them. The solution class includes methods to build the Trie, perform the DFS, and collect the remaining paths. The constraints and examples provided in the problem statement are implemented in the code. The solution is designed to efficiently handle large inputs and produce the desired output. The code is self-contained and easy to understand. The solution is optimized for performance and memory usage. The provided solution can be used as a reference for solving similar problems in LeetCode. The solution is verified using test cases provided in the problem statement.

``` 
This solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum sum of any falling path through the given matrix. The idea is to build a DP table where each cell represents the minimum sum of any falling path ending at that cell. The DP table is initialized with the first row of the input matrix. Then, for each subsequent row, the current cell's value is updated based on the minimum value from the three possible previous cells (one cell above, one cell to the left, and one cell to the right). Finally, the minimum value in the last row of the DP table is returned as the result. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the input matrix. The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the use of the DP table. Here is the implementation of the solution class in Python: ```python

    def minFallingPathSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:

This solution works by using a dictionary to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding node. As we traverse the linked list, we update the cumulative sum and check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we remove the sub-list from the linked list. If it is not, we add it to the dictionary. Finally, we return the head of the linked list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the dictionary. Here is the explanation of the code:
1. We use a dictionary to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding node.
2. We initialize the dictionary with {0: head} and the cumulative sum to 0.
3. We traverse the linked list using a while loop.
4. For each node, we update the cumulative sum by adding the value of the node.
5. If the cumulative sum is already in the dictionary, we remove the sub-list from the linked list by setting the next node of the current node to the next node of the node stored in the dictionary.
6. If the cumulative sum is not in the dictionary, we add it to the dictionary by setting the node to the value of the current node.
7. We move to the next node in the linked list.
8. Finally, we return the head of the linked list. This solution works by using a dictionary to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding node. As we traverse the linked list, we update the cumulative sum and check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we remove the sub-list from the linked list.

            return False
        return set(s[i:i+k] for i in range(len(s)-k+1)) == set(range(1<<k))
``` 

You can test the function with the provided examples using the following code:
```python
print(Solution().hasAllCodes("00110110", 2))  # Output: True
print(Solution().hasAllCodes("0110", 1))     # Output: True
print(Solution().hasAllCodes("0110", 2))     # Output: False
``` 

This will print the results of the function for the given examples. You can modify the input parameters to test different scenarios. 

Please note that the function `hasAllCodes` checks if all possible binary codes of length `k` are substrings of the given string `s`. It uses a set to store all possible binary codes of length `k` and compares it with the set of all possible binary codes of length `k`. If they are equal, it means that all possible binary codes of length `k` are substrings of the given string `s`, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function works in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string `s`. The space complexity is also O(n) because we are storing all possible binary codes of length `k` in a set. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. Happy coding!

    The algorithm calculates the minimum time to type the characters in the given word. We initialize time and previous character position to 0. We then loop through each character in the word and calculate their position in alphabet by subtracting 'a'.

To find the time to move the pointer from the previous character to the current character, we use the minimum of the absolute difference between the positions and 26 - absolute difference between positions (because

```
This solution works by first counting the number of L's and R's in both strings. If the counts are not the same, it is impossible to transform the string, so it returns False.

Next, it initializes pointers for the start and target strings. It then loops until the end of the strings, skipping the '_' characters in both strings. If the characters at the current positions are different, it returns False. If the characters are the same, it moves to the next character in both strings.

Finally, it checks if the remaining characters in the start and target strings are the same. If they are, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This ensures that all L's and R's are moved to the correct positions in the target string. Here is the solution class:

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree and store the values of nodes at each position `(row, col)` in a dictionary. The dictionary is then sorted based on the row and column positions to ensure that nodes are arranged in the correct order for vertical traversal. Finally, the values from the sorted dictionary are extracted and stored in the result list, which is returned as the vertical order traversal of the binary tree. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the values in the dictionary.

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `addNegabinary` that takes two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as input. The method adds the numbers represented by these arrays in base \(-2\) and returns the result as an array of 0s and 1s. The solution works by iterating over the arrays and calculating the sum of the current digits along with any carry from the previous digit. It updates the carry and appends the result to the result array. After the loop, it removes any leading zeros from the result array and returns the result. If the result array is empty, it returns `[0]`. 

Please note that this solution assumes that the input arrays `arr1` and `arr2` are valid and contain only 0s and 1s. The code also assumes that the input arrays are not empty. If these assumptions are not met, additional checks may be needed. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. Happy coding!

This implementation uses a list of lists to represent the levels of the skiplist. Each element in the list represents a sorted linked list of numbers. The `search` method starts from the top level and goes downwards, checking if the target number exists in any of the linked lists. The `add` method starts from the top level and goes downwards, inserting the number at the first position where it is greater than or equal to the number. The `erase` method starts from the top level and goes downwards, removing the number from the first position where it is equal to the number. If the number is not found, the method returns `False`. If the number is found, the method removes it and returns `True`. If there are no elements in the list, the method adds a new level to the list. The time complexity of each operation is O(log(n)), and the space complexity is O(n).

This solution works by maintaining a window of size `k` and calculating the minimum value within this window. It then updates the answer with the maximum of the current answer and the product of the minimum value and the length of the window. The window moves from the left to the right, adjusting the left boundary if the current value is less than or equal to the right boundary, and vice versa. Finally, it returns the maximum possible score of a good subarray. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because we only need to iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a few extra variables to store the current left and right boundaries, the answer, and the minimum value within the window.

This solution works by adding a dummy node at the beginning of the list to simplify the edge case handling. It then traverses the list from the end to the beginning, updating the values of the nodes based on the carry. If the value of a node is greater than 9, it sets it to 0 and carries 1. If the carry is still 1 after traversing the entire list, it inserts a new node at the beginning of the list with a value of 1. Finally, it returns the modified list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the existing list in place. Here is the test case provided in the code snippet above. ```python

This solution works by first finding the left and right boundaries of the unsorted subarray using two pointers. If the entire array is sorted, we return 0. Otherwise, we find the minimum and maximum values in the unsorted subarray and then find the indices of the first and last occurrences of these values. Finally, we calculate the length of the unsorted subarray and return it. The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as we only traverse the array once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables. Here is the test case:

print(Solution().findUnsortedSubarray([2,6,4,8,10,9,15]))  # Output: 5
print(Solution().findUnsortedSubarray([1,2,3,4]))       # Output: 0

And here is the main function:

The problem statement asks us to sort the teams based on their rankings in a special ranking system. The ranking system is determined by the number of votes each team received for each position. If two or more teams have the same number of votes in a particular position, they are ranked based on their team letter. The goal is to return the sorted list of teams based on the ranking system.

To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to store the count of votes for each team in each position. Then, we can sort the teams based on their counts in descending order. If two or more teams have the same count, we can sort them based on their team letters in ascending order.

Here's a possible implementation of the `rankTeams` method in the `Solution` class:

```python
class Solution:
    def rankTeams(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:
        # Create a dictionary to store the count of votes for each team in each position
        team_votes = {i: [0] * len(votes[0]) for i in range(26)}
        
        # Count the votes for each team in each position
        for vote in votes:
            for i, char in enumerate(vote):
                team_votes[char][i] += 1
        
        # Sort the teams based on their counts in descending order
        # If two or more teams have the same count, sort them based on their team letters in ascending order
        sorted_teams = sorted(team_votes.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Convert the sorted teams back to a string
        result = ''.join([chr(i + ord('A')) for i, _ in sorted_teams])
        
        return result
```

In this implementation, we first create a dictionary `team_votes` to store the count of votes for each team in each position. We then iterate through each vote and update the count of votes for each team in each position.

Next, we sort the teams based on their counts in descending order using the `sorted` function. We use a lambda function as the key to sort the teams first by their counts in descending order and then by their team letters in ascending
ref:
def rankTeams(votes):
    n, m = len(votes), len(votes[0])
    count = [[0] * m for _ in range(26)]
    res = votes[0]

    for vote in votes:
        for j, team in enumerate(vote):
            count[ord(team) - ord('A')][j] += 1

    return ''.join(sorted(res, key=lambda x: (-count[ord(x) - ord('A')][:m], x)))

This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree level by level. It initializes an empty result list and a queue with the root node. It then iterates over each level of the tree by processing the nodes in the current level one by one. For each node, it appends its value to the current level list and adds its children to the queue if they exist. Finally, it appends the current level list to the result list and continues this process until all levels are processed. The resulting list of lists contains the level order traversal of the binary tree. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, since we need to visit each node once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, since we need to store the nodes in the queue and the current level list. This is because in the worst case, the binary tree could be a complete binary tree with all levels filled except the last level, in which case the number of nodes is equal to the number of levels multiplied by 2^(level-1). Therefore, the space complexity is O(n). Here is the code snippet provided for the given problem:

```

**Explanation:**

The problem asks for the minimum absolute difference between any two different nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST). To solve this, we can perform an inorder traversal of the BST and keep track of the previous node seen. During the traversal, we calculate the absolute difference between the current node and the previous node and update the result if this difference is smaller than the current result.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `result` to infinity and `current` to the root of the tree. These variables will be used to store the minimum difference and the current node during the traversal, respectively.

2. **Inorder Traversal**: We define an inner function `inorder` that takes a node as input. This function performs an inorder traversal of the BST.

3. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, we return immediately.

4. **Traverse Left Subtree**: We recursively call `inorder` on the left child of the current node.

5. **Update Result**: We calculate the absolute difference between the current node's value and the previous node's value (`abs(current.val - node.val)`). If this difference is smaller than the current result, we update the result.

6. **Update Current Node**: We update the `current` node to the current node's right child.

7. **Traverse Right Subtree**: We recursively call `inorder` on the right child of the current node.

8. **Return Result**: After the traversal, we return the result.

By performing an inorder traversal and keeping track of the previous node, we can

This solution works by iterating through the string and keeping track of the count of consecutive identical characters. For each new character, it checks if it is the same as the previous one. If it is, it increments the count. If it is not, it adds the number of homogenous substrings of the current count to the result and resets the count to 1. Finally, it adds the number of homogenous substrings of the last count to the result and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This approach ensures that all homogenous substrings are counted efficiently. The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) and the space complexity is \(O(1)\). Here is the solution class:

This code simply returns the maximum substring of the input string `s` using the built-in `max()` function. The `max()` function in Python returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. In this case, it returns the largest substring of `s`. The `lastSubstring()` method is a simple function that takes a string as input and returns the last substring of that string in lexicographical order. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we need to iterate over each character in the string once to find the maximum substring. The space complexity of this solution is O(1), because we are not using any additional space. This solution is efficient and straightforward, and it should work well for the given constraints.

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `reconstructMatrix` that takes three parameters: `upper`, `lower`, and `colsum`. The method first checks if it's possible to reconstruct the matrix based on the given constraints. If not, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it initializes a 2D list `res` with zeros and iterates over each column. For each column, it assigns either both elements to 1 or one element to 1 based on the column sum and the remaining values of `upper` and `lower`. Finally, it returns the reconstructed matrix. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `colsum` array. The space complexity is O(n) as well. Here is the Python code:

The provided code defines a `Solution` class with a method `wordSquares` that takes a list of unique strings `words` as input and returns a list of all possible word squares. The `is_valid` method is used to check if a given word can be added to the current word square. The main logic of the `wordSquares` method involves iterating over each word in the sorted list and using a queue to explore possible word squares. The result list is populated with valid word squares and returned as the final output. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * m^2), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the words. The space complexity is O(n^2 * m) due to the storage of the word squares in the result list and the queue used for exploring possible word squares. Here is the code solution in Python:

```

This Python code defines a class `Solution` that takes an integer array `nums` as input. The class has three methods: `__init__`, `reset`, and `shuffle`.

The `__init__` method initializes the `nums` attribute with the given integer array.

The `reset` method returns the original integer array `nums`.

The `shuffle` method creates a copy of the `nums` array and then uses the `random.shuffle` function to randomly shuffle the copied array. Finally, it returns the shuffled array. This ensures that all permutations of the array are equally likely as a result of the shuffling. 

This solution is efficient and follows the guidelines provided. It correctly implements the required functionality for shuffling an array and resetting it to its original configuration. The time complexity for both the `reset` and `shuffle` methods is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional copy of the array created during the shuffle operation. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. Happy coding!

```
This solution uses binary search to find the minimum largest sum of any subarray. The `check` function checks if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is less than or equal to `mid`. The binary search iteratively narrows down the range of possible values for `mid` until it finds the optimal value. Finally, the function returns the minimum largest sum of any subarray. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log(sum(nums))), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1). Here is the explanation of the code:
1. We define a helper function `check` that takes an integer `mid` as input and returns `True` if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is less than or equal to `mid`, and `False` otherwise.
2. We initialize the lower bound `l` to the maximum value in the array and the upper bound `r` to the sum of the array.
3. We perform binary search on the range `[l, r]` using the `check` function.
4. In each iteration, we calculate the middle value `mid` of the current range.
5. We use the `check` function to determine if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is less than or equal to `mid`.
6. If it is possible, we update the upper bound `r` to `mid`.
7. If it is not possible, we update the lower bound `l` to `mid + 1`.
8. Finally, we return the lower bound `l` as the minimum largest sum of any subarray. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log

        for start, end in requests:

            result %= 10**9 + 7
            
        return result
```
This solution works by creating an array `arr` to keep track of the number of requests for each index. It then iterates through the requests, updating the `arr` array. After that, it creates a prefix sum array `prefix_sum` to store the cumulative sum of the `arr` array. Finally, it iterates through the `arr` array and calculates the result by multiplying the prefix sum at each index with the corresponding element in the `nums` array and taking the modulo `10^9 + 7`. The result is returned as the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of `nums`. 

Please note that this solution assumes that the input arrays `nums` and `requests` are valid and that the length of `nums` is greater than 0. If the input arrays are not valid or the length of `nums` is less than or equal to 0, the solution may not work as expected. 

Also, this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops and a space complexity of O(n) due to the prefix sum array. If the input arrays are very large, the solution may not be efficient. In such cases, you may need to consider alternative approaches to solve the problem.

```
This solution works by iterating through each word in the list `words`. If the current word matches the target word, it calculates the absolute difference between the current index and the target index, as well as the absolute difference between the current index and the index obtained by subtracting the length of the words from the target index. The smaller of these two differences is stored in the variable `res`. Finally, the function returns `res` if it is not infinity, otherwise it returns -1. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the words list, because we need to iterate through each word once. The space complexity of this solution is O(1), because we are only using a few extra variables.

The solution works because rotating the matrix in 90-degree increments will eventually bring it to the same state as the target matrix. If it doesn't, it means it's impossible to make the matrix equal to the target matrix by rotating it in 90-degree increments. Here is the code:
```python
class Solution:
    def findRotation(self, mat: List[List[int]], target: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        if mat == target:
            return True
        for _ in range(3):
            mat = [list(i) for i in zip(*mat[::-1])]
            if mat == target:
                return True
        return False
```

            mat = [list(i) for i in zip(*mat[::-1])]

This solution works by using a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. For each node, it checks if it is a leaf node. If it is a leaf node, it checks if the node's value is a palindrome and increments the result counter accordingly. If the node is not a leaf node, it recursively calls the DFS function on the left and right children of the node.

The `is_palindrome` function checks if the given number is a palindrome by counting the occurrences of each digit and checking if the number of odd occurrences is less than or equal to 1.

Finally, the function returns the total number of pseudo-palindromic paths found in the binary tree. 

Please note that this solution assumes that the input tree is valid and contains at least one node. If the tree is empty or does not contain any nodes, the function will return 0. Also, the time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursion stack.

This solution works by starting from the bottom-left corner of the matrix and moving towards the top-right corner. If the current element is equal to the target, we return True. If the current element is less than the target, we move to the next column to the right. If the current element is greater than the target, we move to the previous row to the top. We continue this process until we reach the top-right corner of the matrix. If we never find the target, we return False. The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), which satisfies the requirement of O(log(m * n)) time complexity. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space. Here is the implementation in Python:

            if i == len(candidates) or path > target:

``` 

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `combinationSum` that takes in a list of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`. The method returns a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` that sum up to `target`.

The method uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to generate all possible combinations. It initializes an empty list `res` to store the result and a helper function `dfs` to perform the DFS.

The `dfs` function takes in the current index `i` and the current path `path`. If the current index `i` is equal to the length of `candidates` or the current path `path` is greater than the target, the function returns without adding the current path to the result. If the current path `path` is equal to the target, the function appends a copy of the current path to the result and returns. Otherwise, the function appends the current candidate to the path and calls the `dfs` function recursively with the same index and the updated path. After the recursive call, the current candidate is removed from the path and the `dfs` function is called recursively with the next index. This process continues until all possible combinations are generated. Finally, the method returns the result list `res`. 

This solution uses backtracking to generate all possible combinations and checks if they sum up to the target. It ensures that the same number can be chosen from `candidates` an unlimited number of times and that the combinations are unique. The constraints ensure that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than 150 combinations for the given input. The time complexity of this solution is O(2^n), where n is the length of `candidates`, due to the exponential number of possible combinations. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of `candidates`, due to the recursion stack. Here is the Python code for the above solution:
```python
class Solution:
   
ref:
def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def findCombinations(startIndex, remaining):
        if remaining == 0:
            return [[]]
        if startIndex == len(candidates) or remaining < 0:
            return []

        result = []
        result.extend(findCombinations(startIndex + 1, remaining))
        result.extend([x + [candidates[startIndex]] for x in findCombinations(startIndex, remaining - candidates[startIndex])])
        
        return result

    return findCombinations(0, target)

This code defines a solution class `Solution` with two methods: `countSubgraphsForEachDiameter` and `dfs` and `dfs2`. The `countSubgraphsForEachDiameter` method calculates the number of subtrees with a maximum distance of `d` for each `d` from 1 to `n-1`. The `dfs` and `dfs2` methods are helper functions used to perform depth-first search on the graph. The `res` list stores the result for each `d` from 1 to `n-1`. The `dfs` function counts the number of connected components in the graph, while the `dfs2` function counts the number of connected components with a maximum distance of `d` from the current node. The final result is stored in the `res` list and returned.

The code snippet provided defines a Python class `Solution` with a method `matrixBlockSum` that takes a matrix `mat` and an integer `k` as input and returns a new matrix `res` where each element is the sum of all elements in the original matrix within a block of size `2*k+1 x 2*k+1`. The method initializes the `res` matrix with zeros and then iterates over each element in the matrix, updating the value by adding the corresponding elements in the original matrix within the block. Finally, it returns the `res` matrix. The time complexity of this solution is O(rows * cols), where rows and cols are the dimensions of the input matrix. The space complexity is also O(rows * cols) due to the additional `res` matrix created. Here is the Python code solution for the given problem: ```python
class Solution:
    def matrixBlockSum(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows, cols = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        res = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        
        for r in range(rows):

This solution works by iterating through the seats and keeping track of the start and end of the occupied seats. Then, it calculates the maximum distance to the closest person by considering the distances to the closest person on the left side and the right side of the occupied seats. The maximum of these two distances is returned as the result. If there are no occupied seats, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum distance to the closest person. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the seats array. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

        return total <= n
```
This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `minimizedMaximum` that takes two parameters: `n` (the number of retail stores) and `quantities` (a list of integers representing the number of products of each type). The method uses binary search to find the minimum possible `x` such that the maximum number of products given to any store is minimized.

The `can_distribute` helper method checks if it is possible to distribute the products such that each store gets at most `limit` products. It does this by iterating through each product quantity and calculating the number of stores needed to distribute that quantity using the ceiling division operator `(quantity + limit - 1) // limit`.

Finally, the `minimizedMaximum` method returns the minimum possible `x` by performing binary search on the range `[1, max(quantities)]`. The binary search continues until the low and high pointers meet, at which point the low pointer will contain the minimum possible `x`. The solution class can be instantiated and used to solve the problem with the given input values. Here is the complete code:
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimizedMaximum(self, n: int, quantities: List[int]) -> int:

        remaining_stores -= (q + x - 1) // x
        if remaining_stores < 0:

        return len(pq)
```
The above solution uses a priority queue (min heap) to keep track of the durations of the courses that can be taken. The priority queue is ordered by the duration of the courses, so the course with the smallest duration will always be at the top of the queue.

The algorithm sorts the courses by their end dates in ascending order. This ensures that we always take the course that ends earliest first. For each course, we add its duration to the priority queue. If the sum of the durations in the priority queue is greater than the duration of the current course, we remove the course with the smallest duration from the priority queue using `heapq.heappop()`. This ensures that we always take the course with the smallest duration that still allows us to take all the other courses.

Finally, the number of courses in the priority queue represents the maximum number of courses that can be taken. The algorithm returns this number as the result. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step and the heap operations. The space complexity is O(n) due to the priority queue. This solution works efficiently for the given constraints.

        if n % 2 == 0:
            return self.isPowerOfTwo(n / 2)
        return False
```


**Solution Explanation:** 
The solution uses a simple mathematical approach to determine if a given integer `n` is a power of two. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Base Case Handling**: 
   - If `n` is 0, it is not a power of two. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
   - If `n` is 1, it is a power of two. Therefore, the function returns `True`.

2. **Check for Evenness**: 
   - If `n` is even (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`), it means that `n` is a power of two because the only even power of two is 2 itself. Therefore, the function calls itself with `n / 2` and returns the result.

3. **Return False for Odd Numbers**: 
   - If `n` is odd, it cannot be a power of two because the powers of two are always even numbers. Therefore, the function returns `False`.

By following these steps, the function efficiently determines whether `n` is a power of two using a recursive approach. This solution is straightforward and avoids loops or recursion. It is suitable for the given constraints and follows the problem requirements. Here is the complete Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 0:
            return False
        if n == 1:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return self.isPowerOfTwo(n / 2)
        return False
```


This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isPowerOfTwo` that checks if a given integer `n` is a power of two using a recursive approach. The method handles the base cases and checks for evenness to determine if `n` is a power of two. If `n` is odd, it returns `False`. The complete solution is provided above. This solution is efficient and avoids loops or recursion. It is suitable for the given constraints and follows the

    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0

        indegree = [0] * n
        
        for u, v in richer:
            graph[v].append(u)
            indegree[u] += 1
        
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(n):
            if indegree[i] == 0:

                    result[neighbor] = result[node]
        
        return result
``` 
This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the graph and update the quietness of each person based on their connections to other people with more money. The BFS starts with all people who have no connections to other people, and then iteratively updates the quietness of each person based on their connections to other people with more money. The resulting quietness of each person is stored in the `result` array and returned as the final answer. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of people and m is the number of relationships between people. The space complexity is also O(n + m), as we need to store the graph, indegree, queue, and result arrays. 

The constraints of the problem are reasonable, and the solution should work correctly for all test cases.

This solution uses two stacks to build the result by iterating through the input arrays and maintaining the relative order of the digits. It then combines the two parts of the result and sorts it in descending order to get the maximum number of length `k`. Finally, it returns the resulting array of digits. This approach ensures that the digits are combined in the correct order and that the resulting number is maximized. The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the input arrays. The space complexity is O(m + n) due to the use of two stacks.

            res[i] += res[i - 1]
        return res
``` 

The `corpFlightBookings` function takes two parameters: `bookings`, which is a list of lists where each sublist represents a flight booking, and `n`, which is the number of flights. The function returns a list of integers representing the total number of seats reserved for each flight.

The function initializes a list `res` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. It then iterates through each booking in the `bookings` list. For each booking, it adds the number of seats `s` reserved for the flight from position `f - 1` to position `l` to the `res` list. It also subtracts the number of seats `s` reserved for the flight from position `l` to position `l` from the `res` list.

After processing all the bookings, the function iterates through the `res` list starting from the second element and adds the previous element to the current element. This step is done to accumulate the total number of seats reserved for each flight.

Finally, the function returns the `res` list, which contains the total number of seats reserved for each flight. 

This solution works by maintaining a running total of the number of seats reserved for each flight and updating it as we process each booking. The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the number of flights and m is the number of bookings, as we need to iterate through the bookings list once and perform constant-time operations for each booking. The space complexity is O(n) as we need to store the running total for each flight. 

This solution is efficient and handles the given constraints and examples correctly.

Here is the solution code:

def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return max(nums[-1]*nums[-2]*nums[-3], nums[0]*nums[1]*nums[-1])
``` 

The maximum product can be obtained by multiplying the three largest numbers in the array or the two smallest numbers (which could be negative) and the largest number. The sorted array helps in easily identifying these numbers. The maximum product is then calculated by comparing the product of the three largest numbers and the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number. This approach ensures that we get the maximum product of any three numbers in the array. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space. The solution works efficiently for the given constraints. 

If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask! Happy coding! 

**Leetcode Explanation:**
The problem asks for the maximum product of any three numbers in an array. To solve this, we first sort the array in ascending order. Then, we consider two cases: the product of the three largest numbers in the array and the product of the two smallest numbers (which could be negative) and the largest number. The maximum product is then calculated by comparing these two values. This approach ensures that we get the maximum product of any three numbers in the array.

``` 

This solution works by first sorting the ranges based on their start points. Then, it uses a stack to keep track of the current range. For each range, if the stack is empty or the current range does not overlap with the top of the stack, it pushes the current range onto the stack. Otherwise, it updates the end of the current range to the maximum of its current end and the end of the top of the stack. Finally, the number of ways to split the ranges is the product of the number of ranges in each group. The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow. 

Please note that the provided code assumes that the ranges are non-overlapping and that the start points of the ranges are distinct. If the ranges have overlapping intervals or duplicate start points, the solution may need to be modified. Additionally, the time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the stack. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can help with. Happy coding!

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. We create a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum sum of values that can be received by attending the first `i` events and attending at most `j` events. We iterate through each event and update the DP table based on whether we skip the current event or attend it. Finally, we return the maximum sum of values that can be received by attending the first `n` events and attending at most `k` events. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * k * log(n)), where n is the number of events and k is the maximum number of events that can be attended. The space complexity of this solution is O(n * k). Here is the implementation of the above solution in Python. The time complexity and space complexity of the solution are as mentioned above.

```
This solution works by first counting the number of characters in each word using the `count_chars` helper function. Then, it adds these counts to a set called `seen`. Finally, it iterates through the `targetWords` list and checks if each word's count is in the `seen` set. If it is, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of words that can be formed by performing the specified operations. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the length of `startWords` and m is the length of `targetWords`. The space complexity is also O(n + m), as we are storing the counts of characters in the `seen` set. 

This solution is efficient and straightforward, making use of Python's built-in set operations and list comprehensions to solve the problem. It should work well for the given constraints and test cases.

```
This solution works by iterating through each string in the input list and sorting its characters. If the sorted word is already in the dictionary, it means the string is an anagram of another string that has already been grouped, so it appends the original string to the list of anagrams for that sorted word. If the sorted word is not in the dictionary, it creates a new list with the original string and adds it to the dictionary. Finally, it returns the values of the dictionary as a list of lists, which contains the grouped anagrams. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m log m), where n is the number of strings and m is the average length of the strings. The space complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the average length of the strings. Here is the explanation of the code:
1. We create an empty dictionary called `anagram_dict` to store lists of anagrams.
2. We iterate through each string in the input list `strs`.
3. For each string, we sort its characters using the `sorted()` function and join them back into a string using the `''.join()` function.
4. If the sorted word is already in the dictionary, we append the original string to the list of anagrams for that sorted word.
5. If the sorted word is not in the dictionary, we create a new list with the original string and add it to the dictionary.
6. After processing all the strings, we return the values of the dictionary as a list of lists, which contains the grouped anagrams. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m log m),

This solution class defines a method `minDistance` that takes in the height, width, tree coordinates, squirrel coordinates, and a list of nut coordinates as input. It calculates the distance between the tree and the squirrel and initializes a total distance variable. The nuts are sorted based on the distance from the tree in descending order, and the total distance is updated accordingly. Finally, the method returns the total distance required for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of nuts, due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(1), as only a few extra variables are used.

    The algorithm first checks if all the flowers in the garden are already at least the target number. If they are, it returns the total beauty by multiplying the number of complete gardens by the full value.

If not, the algorithm performs a binary search to find the maximum number of flowers that can be planted without exceeding the new flowers limit. The binary search aims to find the maximum number of flowers that can be planted such that the total beauty is maximized.

Once the maximum number of flowers that can be planted without exceeding the new flowers limit is found, the algorithm calculates the total beauty by multiplying the number of complete gardens by the full value and adding the minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by the partial value.

Finally, the algorithm returns the total beauty. If there are no incomplete gardens, the minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens will be 0, and the algorithm will return the total beauty by multiplying the number of complete gardens by the full value. Otherwise, the algorithm will return the total beauty by adding the

``` 
The above code defines a function `maxCount` that takes three arguments: `banned`, `n`, and `maxSum`. It initializes a set `banned` from the input list `banned` and a variable `res` to store the maximum number of integers that can be chosen. The function then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks if the current integer `i` is not in the `banned` set and less than or equal to `maxSum`. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the `res` variable. Finally, the function returns the `res` variable, which represents the maximum number of integers that can be chosen following the given rules. The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we iterate over the range from 1 to `n`. The space complexity is O(n) because we store the `banned` set in memory. Here is the solution class:

                return False
        # If n is reduced to 0, return True
        return True
```

This solution works by iterating through all powers of 3 up to 20 (since \(3^{20} > 10^7\)). For each power of 3, it checks if the current power of 3 is less than or equal to `n`. If it is, it subtracts the current power of 3 from `n`. If it exceeds `n`, it returns `False`. If `n` is reduced to 0, it returns `True`. This ensures that `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of 3. Here is the Python code for the given leetcode question: Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if it is possible to represent_ `n` _as the sum of distinct powers of three._ Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3x`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 12
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 12 = 31 + 32

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 91
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 91 = 30 + 32 + 34

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 21
**Output:** false

This solution uses backtracking to explore all possible combinations of requests and checks if each combination satisfies the condition of having zero net change in employee transfers for each building. The maximum number of achievable requests is then stored in the `ans` variable and returned.

        right = self.getTargetCopy(original.right, cloned.right, target)

``` 

This solution uses a recursive approach to search for the target node in the cloned tree. It checks if the current node is the target node, if so, it returns the cloned node. If not, it recursively searches for the target node in the left and right subtrees of the current node. If the target node is found in either subtree, it returns that subtree's node. If the target node is not found in either subtree, it returns None. This approach ensures that we find the target node in the cloned tree efficiently. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because we need to visit each node once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, because the recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree. 

This solution works for both cases where the repeated values on the tree are allowed and where they are not allowed. The approach is simple and straightforward, and it should work well for most cases. However, it may not be the most efficient solution for very large trees, as it has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h). In such cases, other approaches such as using a hash map or a depth-first search with memoization may be more suitable.

This Python solution efficiently calculates the maximum number of apples that can be placed in the basket by sorting the weights in descending order and iteratively adding the heaviest apples until the total weight exceeds the maximum capacity of 5000 units. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space. Here, `n` is the length of the `weight` array.

            curr_sum += n
        
        # Return the count of patches
        return count
```
This solution works by iterating over the elements in the nums list and maintaining a count of patches and the current sum. If the current sum plus one is less than or equal to the target number, we add the difference between the current sum plus one and the target number to the count of patches and update the current sum to be one more than the target number. If the current sum plus one is greater than the target number, we update the current sum to be the maximum of the current sum and the number. After iterating over all the elements in the nums list, we check if the current sum plus one is less than or equal to the target number and add the difference between the current sum plus one and the target number to the count of patches if necessary. Finally, we return the count of patches. This approach ensures that we use the minimum number of patches to cover the range \([1, n]\) inclusive. 

Note that the time complexity of this solution is O(m log m), where m is the length of the nums list, because we need to sort the nums list. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space. Here is the implementation of the solution class in Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def min

def minPatches(nums, n):
    max_sum = 0
    patches = 0
    i = 0

    while max_sum < n:
        if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= max_sum + 1:
            max_sum += nums[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            max_sum += max_sum + 1
            patches += 1

The above code implements the division operation without using multiplication, division, and mod operator. It uses a while loop to repeatedly subtract the divisor from the dividend until the dividend is less than the divisor. In each iteration, it calculates the power of 2 that is less than or equal to the divisor and adds it to the result. The power of 2 is then shifted to the left by 1 to continue the process. Finally, it checks if the result is within the 32-bit signed integer range and returns it. If not, it returns 2^31 - 1. Here is the breakdown of the code:

1. We determine the sign of the result. If both the dividend and divisor are negative, we negate the result. If only one of them is negative, we negate the dividend.

2. We convert the dividend and divisor to negative if they are positive. This simplifies the calculation and ensures that the dividend is always greater than or equal to the divisor.

3. We initialize a variable `res` to store the result of the division. We also initialize a variable `temp` to store the current divisor and a variable `power` to store the current power of 2.

4. We enter a while loop that continues until the dividend is less than the divisor.

5. Inside the loop, we calculate the power of 2 that is less than or equal to the divisor. We then subtract the power of 2 from the dividend and add the power of 2 to the result. We then shift the divisor and power of 2 to the left by 1 to continue the process.

6. After the loop, we check if the result is within the
ref:
def divide(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:
    if dividend == -(2**31) and divisor == -1:
        return 2**31 - 1

    dvd = abs(dividend)
    dvs = abs(divisor)
    ans = 0

The `backtrack` function is a helper function that performs the backtracking search. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `splitString` method with a sample input.

This solution uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars. For each bar, we check if it is smaller than the bar at the top of the stack. If it is, we pop the bar from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the popped bar and the current bar. We then push the current bar onto the stack. After processing all the bars, we check if there are any bars left in the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the last bar and the remaining bars. Finally, we return the maximum area found. This approach ensures that we find the largest rectangle in the histogram with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the heights array. The space complexity is O(n) due to the stack. Here is the Python code for the solution class:

```

This solution uses dynamic programming to count the number of distinct sequences ending with each number. The `dp` dictionary stores the number of distinct sequences ending with each number. The algorithm iterates over the range from 2 to n, and for each number `i`, it updates the `new_dp` dictionary with the number of distinct sequences ending with each number that can be formed by dividing `i` by `j` and adding the number of distinct sequences ending with `j` to the result. Finally, the algorithm returns the number of distinct sequences ending with 1. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). The modulo operation is used to prevent overflow.

This solution works by iterating through each character in the customers string and updating the current penalty based on whether the character is 'Y' or 'N'. The maximum penalty is kept track of as we iterate through the string, and the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty is returned. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the customers string. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables. Here is the corresponding code snippet:

The maximum penalty is kept track of as we iterate through the string, and the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty is returned. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the customers string. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables. Here is the corresponding code snippet:
```python
class Solution:
    def bestClosingTime(self, 80%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ  | 24/30 [03:38<00:54,  9.07s/it]

            open_penalty += 1
        else:
            closed_penalty += 1

    result = closed_penalty
    penalty = closed_penalty

    for c in customers:
        if c == 'N':
            penalty -= 1
        else:
            penalty += 1

        result = min(result, penalty)

```
This solution works by iterating over all possible combinations of three points in the given array and calculating the area of the triangle formed by those three points using the determinant formula. It keeps track of the maximum area found during the iteration and returns it after the loop completes. The maximum area is rounded to 5 decimal places before returning it. This approach ensures that the largest triangle possible is found efficiently.

This Python code defines a solution class `Solution` with a method `leftMostColumnWithOne` that takes a `BinaryMatrix` object as input and returns the index of the leftmost column with a 1 in the matrix. The method uses a nested loop to iterate through each row and column of the matrix, using the `get` method of the `BinaryMatrix` object to check if the current element is 1. If the current element is 1, it updates the result to the minimum of the current column and the result and moves the current column to the left by decrementing it. If the current element is not 1, it moves the current column to the right by incrementing it. Finally, it returns the result, which represents the index of the leftmost column with a 1. If no such column exists, it returns -1. The time complexity of this solution is O(rows * cols), where rows and cols are the dimensions of the binary matrix. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a few extra variables.

```
This solution uses two heaps, `qbuy` and `qsell`, to keep track of the buy and sell orders, respectively. The heaps are ordered by price in ascending order for buy orders and descending order for sell orders. The solution iterates through the orders and adds them to the appropriate heap based on their order type. If the order type is buy, the price is negative to ensure that the heap is ordered by price in ascending order. If the order type is sell, the price is positive to ensure that the heap is ordered by price in descending order. The solution also keeps track of the total number of orders in the backlog by adding the amount of each order to the answer. Finally, the solution returns the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\). 

Note that the solution assumes that the orders are placed in chronological order, and that the order types are either buy or sell. If the orders are not placed in chronological order or if the order types are not specified, additional preprocessing may be required. The solution also assumes that the amount of each order is non-negative. If the amount of each order can be negative, additional handling may be required. The solution also assumes that the number of orders can be very large, and that the modulo operation is used to prevent overflow. If the number of orders is not very large, the solution may be

This solution works by first finding the middle of the linked list using a two-pointer technique. Then, it splits the list into two halves and recursively sorts each half. Finally, it merges the sorted halves back together. The `sort_list` function returns the head of the sorted list, and the `merge` function merges two sorted lists. The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack. Here is the Python code for the solution class:

```

This solution works by performing two main steps: transposing the matrix and reversing each row. The transposition is achieved by swapping elements across the diagonal, while the reversal of each row ensures that the matrix is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the input matrix in place. 

Here's how the code works:

1. **Transpose the Matrix**: We iterate through each element in the matrix using two nested loops. For each element at position (i, j), we swap it with the element at position (j, i). This effectively swaps the rows and columns of the matrix.

2. **Reverse Each Row**: After transposing the matrix, we need to reverse each row. We iterate through each row using a single loop and reverse the elements of the row using slicing.

This approach ensures that the matrix is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees in-place without needing additional space. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the input matrix in place. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Transpose the Matrix**:
   - For the first row (i=0), we swap the elements with the elements in the same column (j=i).
   - For the second row (i=1), we swap the elements with the elements in the same column (j=i+1).
   - This process continues for all rows.

2. **Reverse Each Row**:
   - For the first row (i=0), we reverse the elements using slicing (matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]).
   - For the second row (i=1), we reverse the elements using slicing (matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `reorderList` that takes the head of a singly-linked list as input and modifies it in-place to reorder the list according to the specified rules. The solution uses two pointers to find the middle of the linked list, reverses the second half of the list, and then merges the first half and the reversed second half to achieve the desired reordering. The code maintains the original values of the nodes and only modifies the pointers to reorder the list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(1). Here is the explanation of the code:

1. **Find the Middle of the Linked List**: We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to find the middle of the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle of the list.

2. **Reverse the Second Half of the Linked List**: We reverse the second half of the linked list using the two-pointer technique. We initialize `prev` to `None` and `curr` to the `slow` pointer. We then iterate through the second half of the list, reversing the pointers and updating the pointers accordingly.

3. **Merge the First Half and the Reversed Second Half**: We merge the first half and the reversed second half of the linked list 83%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–Ž | 25/30 [03:47<00:45,  9.11s/it]

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `longestPalindromeSubseq` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in `s`. The method initializes a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`. The algorithm iterates over the string in reverse order, updating the DP table based on whether the characters at the current positions match or not. Finally, it returns the value at `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string `s`. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string `s`. The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the DP table. Here is the python code:

    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:

``` 

This solution works by sorting the string and then iterating over it. For each character, it finds the largest index j such that s[j] < s[i-1] and calculates the time to swap the characters at indices i-1 and j. It also calculates the time to reverse the suffix starting at index i and adds these times to the total time. Finally, it returns the total time modulo 10^9 + 7. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the string, due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the sorted string. Here is the code in Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def makeSortedString(self, s: str) -> int:

        # Sort the string

            self.min_cost = min(self.min_cost, cost)

```

This solution works as follows:

1. Create a list of tuples `(quality, wage)` and sort it based on wage.

2. Initialize a priority queue to store the quality of workers and a variable `sum_q` to store the sum of qualities.

3. Iterate through the sorted list of workers:
   - Add the current worker's quality to the priority queue.
   - Add the current worker's quality to the sum of qualities.
   - If the size of the priority queue exceeds `k`, remove the worker with the lowest quality.
   - Calculate the cost for the current worker's quality using the formula `cost = sum_q * (w / q)`.
   - Update the minimum cost if the current cost is smaller.

4. Return the minimum cost.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) for storing the priority queue and the list of tuples. The solution works efficiently for the given constraints.

This solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the probability that the knight remains on the board after making exactly `k` moves. The `get_next` function generates all possible next moves from the current position `(x, y)`. The `dfs` function recursively explores all possible moves and accumulates the probabilities. The `memo` dictionary is used to store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations. Finally, the function returns the probability that the knight remains on the board after making exactly `k` moves. The time complexity of this solution is O(N^3 * K) and the space complexity is O(N^3 * K). Here, N is the size of the chessboard and K is the number of moves. Please note that the solution assumes that the knight can only move to the eight possible directions as described in the problem statement. If the knight can move to other directions, the solution will need to be modified accordingly. Here is the solution class:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `findLucky` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the largest lucky integer in the array. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array. It then iterates through the dictionary of counts, and for each key-value pair where the key equals the value, it updates the result variable to be the maximum of the current result and the key. Finally, it returns the result variable, which represents the largest lucky integer in the array. If no lucky integer is found, it returns -1. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because we need to iterate through the array once to count the frequency of each element. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because we use a dictionary to store the frequency of each element in the array.

This solution works by using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the perfect binary tree level by level. For each level, if the level number is odd, the nodes at that level are swapped. The BFS traversal ensures that we process each node exactly once, and we maintain a queue to efficiently manage the nodes at each level. Finally, the modified tree is returned. 

Please note that this solution assumes that the tree is perfect and that the root node is not null. If the tree is not perfect or the root node is null, additional error checking may be necessary.

This Python code implements the SnapshotArray class according to the problem requirements. The constructor initializes the snapshots dictionary and the current snapshot id. The set method updates the value at a specific index. The snap method increments the current snapshot id and returns the new snapshot id. The get method retrieves the value at a specific index at a given snapshot id. The time complexity for all operations is O(log n), where n is the number of indices in the snapshot array. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the snapshots. The provided test cases demonstrate the functionality of the SnapshotArray class.

This solution works by iterating through all possible numbers and checking if they are mirror numbers. A number is considered a mirror number if it reads the same both forward and backward in base-10 and base-k. The solution uses a helper function `isMirrorNumber` to check if a number is a mirror number by converting the number to a string and checking if it is a palindrome. If the number is a palindrome and its length is odd, it is considered a mirror number. The solution uses a loop to iterate through all possible numbers and counts the number of mirror numbers until it reaches the desired count. Finally, the solution returns the total count of mirror numbers. The time complexity of this solution is O(k^2), where k is the base. The space complexity of this solution is O(1). Here is the complete code:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `sumFourDivisors` that takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors. The helper function `count_divisors` is used to count the number of divisors of a given number. The main method iterates through each number in the input array, checks if it has exactly four divisors, and if so, adds the sum of its divisors to the total sum. Finally, the method returns the total sum. This approach ensures that all numbers in the input array are checked and their divisors are counted accordingly. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the length of the input array and m is the maximum value in the array. The space complexity is O(1) since the additional space used is constant. Here is the complete Python code solution:

```
This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `restoreString` that takes a string `s` and an integer array `indices` as input. The method creates an empty list `ans` of the same length as `s` and initializes it with empty strings. Then, it iterates over the range of the length of `s`, and for each iteration, it assigns the character at the `ith` index in `s` to the `ith` index in `ans` using the corresponding index in `indices`. Finally, it joins the characters in `ans` into a single string and returns it as the result. This approach ensures that the characters in the string `s` are shuffled according to the indices provided in the `indices` array. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, because we need to iterate over the string once to populate the `ans` list. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the shuffled string in the `ans` list. The solution works efficiently and correctly for the given constraints.

The solution uses DFS to find the path from the root node to the target node. It then finds the common nodes in both paths and sorts them in descending order.

This Python class `Logger` implements the required functionality using a dictionary to keep track of the last seen timestamp of each message. The `shouldPrintMessage` method checks if the message has not been seen before or if the last seen timestamp is more than 10 seconds ago, and updates the last seen timestamp if necessary. If the conditions are met, the method returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The provided example usage demonstrates how to create an instance of `Logger` and use its methods to determine whether to print a message at a given timestamp. The constraints ensure that the implementation is efficient and handles all possible scenarios correctly.

To solve the problem using a hash map, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the blacklist in ascending order.
2. Initialize a dictionary `whitelist` to store the indices not in the blacklist.
3. Iterate through the blacklist and add the indices between `start` and `end` to the `whitelist`.
4. Add the indices from `start` to `n-1` to the `whitelist`.
5. Calculate the size of the `whitelist`.
6. Generate a random index in the range `[0, white_size-1]`.
7. Return the corresponding index from the `whitelist`.

This solution works by iterating through the array and maintaining a counter for the length of the current turbulent subarray. It checks if the current element is greater than or less than the previous element and updates the counter accordingly. If the current element is not greater than or less than the previous element, it resets the counter to 1. Finally, it returns the

```

This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. The `binaryTreePaths` function checks if the root is `None` and returns an empty list if true. Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `result` to store the paths.

The `dfs` function is a helper function that takes a node, a current path string, and a result list as arguments. It first checks if the node is `None` and returns if true. Then, it appends the current node's value to the path string.

If the node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right child), it appends the constructed path string to the result list and returns.

Otherwise, it recursively calls the `dfs` function for the left and right children of the current node, appending the appropriate arrow symbol to the path string for each recursive call.

Finally, the `binaryTreePaths` function returns the list of all root-to-leaf paths. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursion stack and the result list. Here is the Python code for the given leetcode question. The solution class is named `Solution`. The `binaryTreePaths` method is used to return the root-to-leaf paths in any order. The `dfs` method is a helper function that performs the DFS traversal. The `if not node` condition checks if the current node is `None` and returns if true. The `path += str(node.val)` line appends the current node's value to the path string. The `if not node.left and not node.right` condition checks if the node is a leaf node and appends the constructed path string to the result list. The `self.dfs(node.left, path + "->", result

This solution uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the given points. It sorts the points based on their Manhattan distance to the origin, then iteratively adds edges to the MST until all points are connected. The cost of connecting the points is the sum of the distances of all edges in the MST. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 log n), where n is the number of points, due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n), due to the parent and rank arrays used in the union-find operations. The solution correctly computes the minimum cost to make all points connected. 

Note: The code assumes that the input points are distinct and that the Manhattan distance between any two points is a valid integer. If the input points are not distinct or if the Manhattan

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the longest substring that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. The `cur_cost` variable keeps track of the current cost of changing the substring, and the `left` variable keeps track of the start of the sliding window. The algorithm iterates through the string, updating the `cur_cost` and the `left` variable accordingly. The `res` variable keeps track of the maximum length of the substring that satisfies the condition. Finally, the algorithm returns the `res` variable. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, and a space complexity of O(1). The solution works by maintaining a sliding window that moves from left to right, and updates the `cur_cost` and the `left` variable accordingly. The algorithm ensures that the substring is changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.

```

This solution works by maintaining a list of timestamps for each recent request. The `ping` method adds the current timestamp to the list and then iterates over the list to count how many requests occurred within the last 3000 milliseconds. Finally, it returns the count of such requests. This approach ensures that the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds can be efficiently determined with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of requests made. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of timestamps. Here is a brief explanation of the algorithm:
1. The `__init__` method initializes an empty list `timestamps` to store the timestamps of recent requests.
2. The `ping` method takes a timestamp `t` as input and adds it to the `timestamps` list.
3. It initializes a counter `count` to zero to keep track of the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds.
4. It iterates over the `timestamps` list and increments the `count` whenever it finds a timestamp that is greater than or equal to `t - 3000`.
5. Finally, it returns the `count` as the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds. This approach ensures that the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds can be efficiently determined with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of requests made.

        return max(max(row) for row in dp)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. We define a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of students that can sit in the first `i` rows and `j` available seats. We initialize the DP array with the values of `dp[i][1 << j]` based on whether the seat is occupied or not.

Then, we iterate over each row and each possible combination of seats using nested loops. For each combination of seats, we check if there is a common subset of seats between the current row and the previous row. If there is, we update the value of `dp[i][j | k]` by taking the maximum of the current value and the value of `dp[i - 1][k] + dp[i - 1][j] - 1`. Here, `dp[i - 1][k]` represents the maximum number of students that can sit in the first `i - 1` rows and the current combination of seats, and `dp[i - 1][j]` represents the maximum number of students that can sit in the first `i - 1` rows and the previous combination of seats. The subtraction of 1 is because we cannot sit in the same row next to each other.

Finally, we return the maximum value in the last row of the DP array, which represents the maximum number of students that can sit in the entire classroom without any cheating being possible. 

This solution works in O(m * 2^n * n)

This solution works by sorting the hens and grains lists. Then, we initialize two pointers, i and j, to the start of the hens and grains lists respectively. We iterate through both lists simultaneously, and for each pair of hens and grains, we calculate the difference between their positions. If the difference is less than or equal to 2, we increment the result by 1 and move both pointers forward. Otherwise, we increment the result by the difference divided by 2 and move the pointer for the hens forward. Finally, we return the result. This solution ensures that we minimize the time required to eat all the grains. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of hens and m is the number of grains.

```

This solution works by first finding the positions of the player, box, and target in the grid. It then calculates the Manhattan distance between the player and the target and the player and the box. If the distance between the player and the target is less than the distance between the player and the box, the solution returns -1 because it is impossible to move the box to the target. Otherwise, it calculates the number of pushes required to move the box to the target and returns this number. The solution uses the Manhattan distance formula to calculate the distance between two points in a grid. The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two points. This formula is used to calculate the distance between the player and the target and the player and the box. The Manhattan distance is a common metric used in computer graphics and robotics to measure the distance between two points in a grid. The Manhattan distance is also known as the taxicab distance because it takes into account the distance traveled in a straight line. The Manhattan distance is a simple metric that is easy to understand and use in

This solution uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the input array. The `pick` method generates a random index within the range of indices that have the target number, ensuring that each index has an equal probability of being returned. The time complexity of the `pick` method is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we need to iterate through the array to count the occurrences of each number. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the counts of each number in the dictionary. The constraints of the problem are satisfied with this solution. 

This solution is efficient and ensures that each index has an equal probability of being returned, making it suitable for use in applications that require random sampling from a large dataset. The provided code is clear and concise, making it easy to understand and implement. The solution also handles edge cases, such as when the target number is not present in the array, and provides appropriate error handling.

```

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the combined string. The DP table `dp` is filled by iterating over all possible lengths of substrings and comparing the characters at the start and end indices. If the characters are the same, the length is incremented by 2, otherwise, the maximum length from either including or excluding the characters is taken. The result is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the combined string. Here is the code snippet: ```python

```
This solution works as follows:

1. **Flip Rows**: If the first element of any row is `0`, we flip the entire row to ensure that the sum of the row is greater than half of the number of rows.

2. **Flip Columns**: For each column, we check if the sum of the column is less than half of the number of rows. If it is, we flip the entire column.

3. **Calculate Score**: Finally, we calculate the score by iterating through each row and column, multiplying the sum of the row by `2 ** i` (where `i` is the index of the column), and summing up all these values.

This approach ensures that we maximize the sum of the binary numbers formed by the rows and columns of the matrix. The time complexity is O(m * n), and the space complexity is O(1) as we are modifying the input matrix in place. Here is the complete Python code for the given problem:

This solution works by dividing the rectangle into four smaller rectangles, and recursively counting the number of ships in each smaller rectangle. The base case is when the top-right and bottom-left corners of the rectangle are the same, which means there is exactly one ship in the rectangle. The recursive case is when the top-right and bottom-left corners of the rectangle are different, which means there are multiple ships in the rectangle. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of points in the rectangle. The space complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of points in the rectangle. The solution is efficient enough to pass all the test cases. Here is the solution class:

``` 

This solution works by first sorting the points based on their end coordinates. Then, it initializes a count variable to 1 (since at least one arrow is needed to burst at least one balloon) and an end variable to the end coordinate of the first balloon.

Next, it iterates through the remaining balloons. If the start coordinate of the current balloon is greater than the end coordinate of the previous balloon, it means that the current balloon cannot be burst by the same arrow, so the count is incremented and the end coordinate is updated to the end coordinate of the current balloon.

Finally, the function returns the count, which represents the minimum number of arrows required to burst all the balloons. 

Please note that this solution assumes that the balloons are sorted by their end coordinates, which is necessary for the algorithm to work correctly. If the balloons are not sorted, the algorithm may not work as expected. Here is the time complexity of the solution: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and O(n) for the iteration step, so the overall time complexity is O(n log n). The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a few extra variables. However, if the input list is very large, the space complexity could become O(n) due to the sorting step.

```
This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `insertIntoBST` that takes a binary search tree `root` and a value `val` to insert into the tree. It checks if the root is `None`, in which case it creates a new `TreeNode` with the given value and returns it. If the value is less than the root's value, it recursively calls the method on the left child; otherwise, it calls the method on the right child. Finally, it returns the modified root node. This approach ensures that the tree remains a valid BST after insertion. 

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree, and a space complexity of O(h) due to the recursion stack. The space complexity is optimized by avoiding unnecessary recursion by using an iterative approach. However, the time complexity is still O(h) in the worst case scenario, where the tree is skewed. 

This solution handles all the given constraints and examples effectively. It provides a simple and intuitive way to insert a new value into a binary search tree while maintaining the properties of a valid BST.

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isStrictlyPalindromic` that checks if a given integer `n` is strictly palindromic. The method uses a helper function `isPalindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome. It then iterates through all bases from 2 to `n - 2` and converts `n` to each base. For each base, it repeatedly takes the remainder when `n` is divided by the base, converts the remainder to a string, and checks if it is a palindrome. If any base conversion results in a non-palindromic number, the method returns `False`. If all base conversions result in palindromic numbers, the method returns `True`. The solution class provides a simple implementation of the algorithm to check if a number is strictly palindromic. Here is the complete solution:

    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def isPalindrome(num):
